        "summary": "Hegseth and the woman who accused him of sexual assault were in Monterey for the 2017 California Federation of Republican Women biennial conference",
        "text": "A California police report involving a sexual assault allegation against Pete Hegseth was released Wednesday, and contains new information about the incident.\n\n The former Fox News host, 44, was involved in the October 2017 investigation of an alleged sexual assault that took place at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Monterey, Calif, the city confirmed in a press release on Nov. 14. President-elect Donald Trump nominated Hegseth for defense secretary one day earlier, on Nov. 13.\n\n The police report, which was first obtained and made public by Mediaite.com on Wednesday, Nov. 20, reveals contrasting accounts of the actions of Hegseth and the woman involved in the incident. The report contains firsthand and witness accounts, as well as descriptions of surveillance footage.\n\n While portions of the report are redacted to protect the privacy of the woman, details from multiple sources in the report contradict Hegseth's account of the events.\n\n According to the document, both Hegseth and the woman were in Monterey for the 2017 California Federation of Republican Women biennial conference, where Hegseth was the keynote speaker. The woman helped organize the event, the report states.\n\n Per the report, the woman had gaps in memory from that night. She recalled being \"buzzed,\" but not drunk, and later told the nurse who did her sexual assault exam that something could have been slipped into her drink.\n\n Hegseth has never been charged in connection to the alleged assault.\n\n Per the report, he said he ensured the woman was “comfortable with what was going on between the two of them,” and that there was “‘always’ conversation and ‘always’ consensual contact.”\n\n “This police report confirms what I’ve said all along, that the incident was fully investigated, and police found the allegations to be false, which is why no charges were filed,” Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth’s attorney, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Parlatore's comment comes days after he responded to Monterey city official's initial confirmation of the investigation. At the time, he said, “An allegation was made and was fully investigated and he was cleared. This should have no effect whatsoever on the nomination process.”\n\n Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman on the president-elect's transition team, expressed similar sentiments on Thursday, telling CNN that the \"police found the allegations to be false.\" The report, however, does not come to the conclusion that the accusation was false.\n\n Per CNN, Hegseth's attorney said the TV personality made a settlement agreement with the woman in 2020. The agreement reportedly included payment and a confidentiality clause.",

        "text": "Seyi Tinubu, the son of President Bola Tinubu, has continued to trend on social media following the news of his endorsement for Lagos State governorship position by the Coalition of Nigerian Youth Leaders (CONYL).\n\nThe coalition, which serves as the umbrella body for youth groups drawn from across the six geopolitical zones of the country, endorsed Seyi Tinubu to run for the position in the 2027 general elections.\n\nIn a statement jointly issued in Owerri on Tuesday by the President-General of CONYL, Comrade Goodluck Ibem; the Secretary, Comrade Junard Abubakar; the Public Relations Officer, Comrade Iniobong Sampson; and the Publicity Secretary, Comrade Adeyemo Adewale, the body stated that the resolution was reached at an enlarged meeting of its leaders held recently.\n\nWhile explaining the reasons for the endorsement in another statement on Thursday, Comrade Ibem insisted that Seyi Tinubu is a man of integrity, transparency, and accountability. He added that Seyi is driven by an overflowing zeal to become a blessing to his people.\n\nThe endorsement, however, has continued to spark mixed reactions from various quarters.\n\nReacting to the development, a youth group under the aegis of the Coalition of Lagos Indigenous Youths issued a statement on Thursday rejecting the endorsement. They asserted that there is no vacancy for a non-indigene to occupy the Alausa Government House.\n\nALSO READ: Why we endorsed Seyi Tinubu for Lagos Governor in 2027 — CONYL\n\nThe statement reads partly, “While we know Mr Seyi Tinubu has his democratic rights as a Nigerian, we condemn the ill-fated endorsement and described it as anti-democracy and a deliberate move by some faceless individuals to deny indigenes of Lagos State right to govern themselves in 2027.”\n\nAlso reacting to the development, some netizens have taken to X to air their opinion about the endorsement. \n\nIn his own reaction, an X user, @notesbylawal described the development as a dead ambition, stressing that it is just a mere distraction. \n\nHe wrote, “This Seyi Tinubu saga is a dead ambition, and if they attempt it, it is the end of whatever mafia that is holding Lagos. At best, I think it’s a distraction from something else.”\n\nAnother user, @Michael Emiabata wrote, “I believe the masterminds of this article are based in Imo State and not in Lagos. My advice is that since Seyi’s father is from Osun State, he should pursue his governorship ambition in Osun State or Imo State, where they are clamoring for him to be governor of Lagos State. Lagos State youths are not interested in his governorship ambition.”\n\n“Since when did the office of the governor become an award that some clowns will be nominating Seyi Tulumbu to receive it?” @Imbigup opined. \n\nSupporting the endorsement, @ChiefOses tweeted, “America has had two sets of father-son presidents. John Adams and his son. George Bush and his son. Seyi has my full support.”\n\nALSO READ TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE \n\n\r\n\r\nGet real-time news updates from Tribune Online!

        "summary": "New figures released by the Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) show the ministry covered £50.3 million of the final figure.",
        "text": "The cost to taxpayers of King Charles’ ‘cut-price’ coronation last year was £72 million.\n\nNew figures released by the Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) show the ministry covered £50.3 million of the final figure, with a further £21.7 million coming from the Home Office to meet policing around the event, which was watched by an estimated two billion people globally.\n\nThat compares to £162 million spent on the late Queen Elizabeth’s funeral and £8.77 billion on hosting the London 2012 Olympics.\n\nIn the run up to the May 2023 event there was huge debate over the cost of holding such an historic state occasion against the background of a cost of living crisis.\n\nBoth Buckingham Palace and the government made clear they felt that while costs needed to be kept down, the event was also both an historic occasion and a once-in-a-lifetime chance to showcase ‘UK plc’ on a global stage.\n\nCertain elements of the event - codenamed ‘Operation Golden Orb’ - were very much ‘stripped down’, particularly in comparison with 1953 when Queen Elizabeth was crowned.\n\nThe guest list was slashed from 8,000 invitees to just 2,000, with many peers left off the guest list and those invited told not to wear their traditional gowns.\n\nVelvet chairs especially made for the late Queen’s coronation were replaced with standard seating.\n\nBut there was still enough pomp and pageantry on the day, supporters argued, to satisfy traditionalists.\n\nA DCMS spokesman said: ‘The Coronation was a historic state occasion that brought together millions of people across the country, the realms and the Commonwealth.\n\n 'It was an important diplomatic event, and the biggest gathering of world leaders in a generation, putting Britain on a global stage and showcasing the best of British culture and creativity to the world.\n\n‘In line with rules regulating the spending of taxpayers money, all efforts were made to keep costs to a minimum.’\n\nBuckingham Palace declined to comment, saying it was a matter for the government.\n\nBut sources have stressed the coronation was both ‘a state occasion and a historic one, which showcased the dynamism of the UK on a global stage’.\n\nIt attracted 450 official representatives from 185 overseas countries and territories, with an estimated two billion people watching the event worldwide.\n\nThis meant, they said, that ‘the eyes of the world were on the UK for a once-in-a generation event’ which paid dividends to the country in terms of global interest and investment.\n\nUK Hospitality alone predicted a £350 million boost to the service industry as a result, both from tourism and home-grown celebrations over the coronation weekend.\n\nAnother source added: ‘The coronation proved that the soft power of the Royal Family to this country is unique. It was both a moment of national unity and in investment in the country globally.\n\n‘Plans were scaled back massively from those in place in 1953 to keep costs down and a lot of thought went into seeking the right balance given the challenging financial environment.\n\n‘The government were keen for this to be a big state event given the global interest.’",

        "text": "Speaker of the House of Representatives Rt. Hon. Abbas Tajudeen on Thursday, assured that the House would do everything humanly possible to continue to invest in the Nigerian youth, especially in the area of education.\n\nThe Speaker noted that the Nigerian youth have a lot of potential, which is why they must be empowered to take charge as leaders of tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker Abbas disclosed this when he hosted the Fellows of the Mandela Washington Fellowship Alumni Association of Nigeria during a courtesy visit at his office on Thursday.\n\nThe Nigerian alumni association was in company of other Fellows from some African countries, including Botswana, Gambia, Kenya, Namibia, Senegal, Lesotho, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Benin Republic, Angola, Egypt, Ghana and a host of others.\n\nThe Fellows from other African countries are in Nigeria for the Africa Youth Month programme, which commenced on Thursday.\n\nSpeaker Abbas said: “From the brief I got, this is the 10th year of this programme, and a lot of young people from Africa have participated, Nigeria being the biggest beneficiary, probably because of our population.\n\n“We feel very proud of you, knowing that all the skills you’ve acquired over the years will be put to active use.”\n\nThe Speaker said the House has in “its own little way initiated series of programmes tailored towards catching the best among the youth.”\n\nHe noted: “We have the Legislative Mentorship Initiative (LMI), which is a good programme for the young people drawn from the 36 states and FCT, where we give them training for some weeks and integrate them into the society.\n\n“That initiative has, in no small way, helped in shaping the culture of our youth. We intend to expand it in years to come so that more youth will be captured.\n\n“The House, and the National Assembly, by extension, will continue to do everything humanly possible to continue to invest in training our youth, particularly in the area of education.”\n\nHe told the visiting fellows that the House had resolved to engage about 10 of the LMI cohorts as legislative aides to be attached to different committees to learn the legislative process and leadership.\n\nSpeaker Abbas informed the Fellows, especially those from other African countries, that the House has two youth-related committees, namely: the Committee on Youth Development and the Committee on Youth in Parliament.\n\n“We have about 40 young people in the 10th House, and they’re doing credibly well.”\n\nHe noted that, “in a country like ours, where we have about 70 percent of the population as youth, we have no choice than to dedicate much of our resources towards ensuring that they receive the best of training, the best of education.”\n\nHe said President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is also doing his best towards ensuring that the younger ones are given the best attention in this dispensation.\n\n“I’m sure you’re aware that a scheme similar to what obtains in developed economies has just come on board in Nigeria, where students who cannot afford tuition fees can obtain loan to pay their school fees and repay the government after graduation. Thousands of students have accessed the facility so far.\n\n“Mr. President has accepted that in the 2025 budget, the provision for the scheme will likely be doubled so that we can take a minimum of 200,000 students.\n\n“The House is fully in support of the Executive to ensure that the programmes aimed at developing the youth are achieved,” he said.\n\nEarlier, the President of the Nigerian Alumni Association, Farida Yahaya, informed the Speaker that in the last 10 years, a total of 7,200 young people from Africa attended the program, which is a flagship program for the Department of States.\n\nShe said the Nigerian contingent has the largest number, 678, from all the 36 states and the FCT.\n\n“We have alumni from both the public and private sectors. We have come to you so that you will know what we are doing in the area of sustainable development.\n\n“These young people have come from different African countries to learn from your leadership and wisdom and be able to share with you what they are doing.\n\n“We also have the Nigeria Youth Future’s Fund. They had a session this morning, where undergraduate students debated the kind of Nigeria we want, and winners have emerged.”\n\nThe winners were from the University of Lagos, Federal University of Technology, Akure and the Benue State University. They were presented with cash rewards.\n\nSpeaker Abbas, as part of efforts to encourage the winners, announced a donation of N1 million each to the winners.\n\n\r\n\r\nGet real-time news updates from Tribune Online!

        "title": "California teachers are cursing Donald Trump in the classroom. Is it their right?",
        "summary": "What are teachers' rights to express their political views? We went to 1st Amendment experts to find out.",
        "text": "By Clara Harter, Los Angeles Times (TNS)\n\nLOS ANGELES — Several Southern California teachers are facing disciplinary action after fervid anti-Trump outbursts made in the wake of the November election that rattled school communities and generated fierce debate over teachers’ rights to share their political views.\n\nA Moreno Valley teacher was placed on leave this month after a racially charged, expletive-laden rant attacking Donald Trump and his supporters.\n\nMeanwhile, two high school teachers, one in Chino and one in Cerritos, are under investigation for angry outbursts in response to students wearing MAGA gear in class. And a Beverly Hills High School substitute teacher said she was disciplined for her online posts criticizing President-elect Donald Trump and condemning the behavior of students at a MAGA rally on campus.\n\nEach instance has its nuances, but they collectively raise the question: What are teachers’ rights to express their political views? We went to 1st Amendment experts to find out.\n\nGenerally speaking, K-12 teachers do not have a 1st Amendment right to share partisan speech in the classroom but are offered broad protections to do so online, said Peter Eliasbert, chief counsel for the ACLU of Southern California.\n\nIf you add curse words and racially charged language on top of partisan classroom speech, teachers are even more likely to face discipline, he added.\n\nIn the Moreno Valley incident, the high school teacher used the F-word, called Trump a “rapist draft-dodging coward,” blamed Black and brown men for Trump’s victory and told students that a lot of Latino men — including their fathers, uncles and grandfathers — want to be white.\n\n“Clearly the teacher was acting inappropriately with respect to the students,” said attorney Michael Overing, who teaches 1st Amendment rights at USC. “The language was inappropriate. The racist comments were inappropriate.”\n\nAt Chino High School, a teacher was recorded telling a student wearing a Trump hat that he was “voting for a freaking rapist” and calling Trump supporters “a bunch of losers” and “fake Christians.” A spokesperson for the Chino Valley Unified School District said the matter was immediately investigated, but the district is unable to comment on potential discipline.\n\nOvering explained that there is a narrow set of circumstances in which teachers can express political opinions.\n\nFor example, they are allowed to make an educational point by playing devil’s advocate in a class debate on contemporary American politics. But, he said, if the political speech is not directly relevant to the subject at hand, or isn’t expressed in a respectful, age-appropriate manner, schools probably have a right to restrict it.\n\nTalking politics is welcomed at Cerritos High School within certain parameters, according to a spokesperson for ABC Unified.\n\nRecently, a teacher at the school reportedly stormed out of a classroom because a student was wearing a Trump hat. The spokesperson said in a statement that the incident was under investigation but noted that teachers are encouraged to “use real-life issues, like the recent elections, to have meaningful and age-appropriate classroom discussions with students.”\n\nThe rules around political speech differ significantly when it comes to online posts.\n\nEliasberg said public school teachers have strong 1st Amendment protections to share their political views online — expletives and all. Private schools may have stricter requirements for teachers’ off-campus conduct, but they are still subject to the California Labor Code, which states that it is illegal to fire an employee for their political behavior, he said.\n\nProblems, however, could arise if the online political posts call into question a teacher’s ability to do their job, he said.\n\n“If they make certain statements that could have a very deleterious effect or be very disruptive in the class, then the district may have some ability to engage in discipline,” Eliasberg said. “Part of a teacher’s job is to be non-discriminatory on a variety of different bases: race, religion, sexual orientation and so on.”\n\nIn the case of Beverly Hills High School, the substitute teacher, who reported being disciplined and said she no longer works at the school, shared a wide variety of posts generally criticizing Trump. However, she also criticized students who participated in a MAGA rally and said they were harassing and intimidating minority students.\n\nIn a statement, Beverly Hills Unified Supt. Michael Bregy said the district could not comment on this specific incident but added that no employee was dismissed in the last month. He also said the district is committed to cultivating a culture of respect where differences are embraced, every perspective heard and all voices valued.\n\nAbout a dozen Black students expressed their concerns about the Beverly Hills High School MAGA rally, saying they were subjected to harassment and racial slurs at a recent school district Board of Trustees meeting.\n\n“If it’s a general statement about something that happened at the school and the students’ reaction, I think the district’s on very shaky ground to have disciplined a teacher for doing that,” Eliasberg said, referring to the Beverly Hills substitute’s posts.\n\nOvering, on the other hand, said that because the Beverly Hills substitute teacher’s online posts about the rally ignored the proper channels for disciplining students, she could have fallen afoul of district policy.\n\n“Schools have disciplinary boards to be consistent in punishment and to make sure the facts are investigated and that the true culprits are brought to answer,” he said. “A teacher making comments ‘out of school’ is not following protocol.”\n\nOne area that’s more clear-cut is the right to wear T-shirts or badges expressing political views in the classroom.\n\nCourts have upheld that schools have a right to ban teachers from engaging in such behavior, but they cannot extend this ban to students, according to the ACLU.\n\nIn Cerritos, the teacher who stormed out of the classroom criticized the school for allowing students, and not teachers, to wear political clothing in an email sent to students, Los Cerritos News reported.\n\n“It is not a neutral stance when one group is allowed to express their political views … and the other side is silenced under threat of losing their job and/or being seriously reprimanded,” she wrote.\n\nThe teacher who had an angry outburst at Chino High School also shared frustrations about the differing rules for teacher versus student clothing.\n\n“If I can’t wear a Harris [hat] you can’t wear it,” he said, referencing a student’s Trump hat, according to a recording of the outburst.\n\nIn the 1969 Supreme Court case Tinker vs. Des Moines, the court ruled in favor of students’ 1st Amendment rights after students who planned to wear black armbands to protest the Vietnam War were threatened with suspension. This ruling established the precedent that public school officials can’t censor student speech unless it substantially disrupts the educational process.\n\nTeachers remain under stricter standards, and courts have held that a school may discipline educators for wearing T-shirts or buttons with political messages or slogans, and for putting up political classroom decorations.\n\n©2024 Los Angeles Times.

We went to 1st Amendment experts to find out.\n\nGenerally speaking, K-12 teachers do not have a 1st Amendment right to share partisan speech in the classroom but are offered broad protections to do so online, said Peter Eliasbert, chief counsel for the ACLU of Southern California.\n\nIf you add curse words and racially charged language on top of partisan classroom speech, teachers are even more likely to face discipline, he added.\n\nIn the Moreno Valley incident, the high school teacher used the F-word, called Trump a “rapist draft-dodging coward,” blamed Black and brown men for Trump’s victory and told students that a lot of Latino men — including their fathers, uncles and grandfathers — want to be white.\n\n“Clearly the teacher was acting inappropriately with respect to the students,” said attorney Michael Overing, who teaches 1st Amendment rights at USC. “The language was inappropriate. The racist comments were inappropriate.”\n\nAt Chino High School, a teacher was recorded telling a student wearing a Trump hat that he was “voting for a freaking rapist” and calling Trump supporters “a bunch of losers” and “fake Christians.” A spokesperson for the Chino Valley Unified School District said the matter was immediately investigated, but the district is unable to comment on potential discipline.\n\nOvering explained that there is a narrow set of circumstances in which teachers can express political opinions.\n\nFor example, they are allowed to make an educational point by playing devil’s advocate in a class debate on contemporary American politics. But, he said, if the political speech is not directly relevant to the subject at hand, or isn’t expressed in a respectful, age-appropriate manner, schools probably have a right to restrict it.\n\nTalking politics is welcomed at Cerritos High School within certain parameters, according to a spokesperson for ABC Unified.\n\nRecently, a teacher at the school reportedly stormed out of a classroom because a student was wearing a Trump hat. The spokesperson said in a statement that the incident was under investigation but noted that teachers are encouraged to “use real-life issues, like the recent elections, to have meaningful and age-appropriate classroom discussions with students.”\n\nThe rules around political speech differ significantly when it comes to online posts.\n\nEliasberg said public school teachers have strong 1st Amendment protections to share their political views online — expletives and all. Private schools may have stricter requirements for teachers’ off-campus conduct, but they are still subject to the California Labor Code, which states that it is illegal to fire an employee for their political behavior, he said.\n\nProblems, however, could arise if the online political posts call into question a teacher’s ability to do their job, he said.\n\n“If they make certain statements that could have a very deleterious effect or be very disruptive in the class, then the district may have some ability to engage in discipline,” Eliasberg said. “Part of a teacher’s job is to be non-discriminatory on a variety of different bases: race, religion, sexual orientation and so on.”\n\nIn the case of Beverly Hills High School, the substitute teacher, who reported being disciplined and said she no longer works at the school, shared a wide variety of posts generally criticizing Trump. However, she also criticized students who participated in a MAGA rally and said they were harassing and intimidating minority students.\n\nIn a statement, Beverly Hills Unified Supt. Michael Bregy said the district could not comment on this specific incident but added that no employee was dismissed in the last month. He also said the district is committed to cultivating a culture of respect where differences are embraced, every perspective heard and all voices valued.\n\nAbout a dozen Black students expressed their concerns about the Beverly Hills High School MAGA rally, saying they were subjected to harassment and racial slurs at a recent school district Board of Trustees meeting.\n\n“If it’s a general statement about something that happened at the school and the students’ reaction, I think the district’s on very shaky ground to have disciplined a teacher for doing that,” Eliasberg said, referring to the Beverly Hills substitute’s posts.\n\nOvering, on the other hand, said that because the Beverly Hills substitute teacher’s online posts about the rally ignored the proper channels for disciplining students, she could have fallen afoul of district policy.\n\n“Schools have disciplinary boards to be consistent in punishment and to make sure the facts are investigated and that the true culprits are brought to answer,” he said. “A teacher making comments ‘out of school’ is not following protocol.”\n\nOne area that’s more clear-cut is the right to wear T-shirts or badges expressing political views in the classroom.\n\nCourts have upheld that schools have a right to ban teachers from engaging in such behavior, but they cannot extend this ban to students, according to the ACLU.\n\nIn Cerritos, the teacher who stormed out of the classroom criticized the school for allowing students, and not teachers, to wear political clothing in an email sent to students, Los Cerritos News reported.\n\n“It is not a neutral stance when one group is allowed to express their political views … and the other side is silenced under threat of losing their job and/or being seriously reprimanded,” she wrote.\n\nThe teacher who had an angry outburst at Chino High School also shared frustrations about the differing rules for teacher versus student clothing.\n\n“If I can’t wear a Harris [hat] you can’t wear it,” he said, referencing a student’s Trump hat, according to a recording of the outburst.\n\nIn the 1969 Supreme Court case Tinker vs. Des Moines, the court ruled in favor of students’ 1st Amendment rights after students who planned to wear black armbands to protest the Vietnam War were threatened with suspension. This ruling established the precedent that public school officials can’t censor student speech unless it substantially disrupts the educational process.\n\nTeachers remain under stricter standards, and courts have held that a school may discipline educators for wearing T-shirts or buttons with political messages or slogans, and for putting up political classroom decorations.\n\n©2024 Los Angeles Times.

        "title": "Are Agentic Applications A Threat To All Workflow Apps?",
        "summary": "UiPath is touting a different approach to AI agents that combines them with robotic process automation to handle different aspects of business processes.",
        "text": "Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nDaniel Dines, cofounder and CEO of UiPath.\n© 2021 Bloomberg Finance LP\n\nLast month leaders at UiPath invited me to attend the company’s Forward conference after reading my article in Forbes about AI agents. The conversations that arose led to some interesting insights about agentic AI applications, which are attracting more attention for enterprise uses by the day.\n\nFor those of you who don’t know about UiPath, the company makes a technology platform that historically focused on robotic process automation. RPA (which doesn’t usually involve mechanical robots) is a technique that helps digitize highly structured business processes. When it’s implemented properly, RPA can lead to increased accuracy and speed and decreased costs, among other benefits. Often RPA is used for tasks most humans would not necessarily want to do all day long. A great example of RPA is the digitization of paper-based documents (say, checks issued by banks) into digital records or transactions (e.g., updating financial and banking backends). In fact, UiPath has a significant base of intellectual property in the machine learning and document processing functions necessary for RPA.\n\nA New Agentic Strategy Announced At UiPath Event\n\nThe main focus of Forward was what CEO Daniel Dines called Chapter 3.0 of the organization, which will more heavily focus on agentic applications as well as RPA. It’s an interesting direction, given that many demonstrations of AI agents from the likes of Salesforce and ServiceNow suggest that agents may take the place of RPA. But after having a conversation with UiPath CTO Raghu Malpani, I am convinced that UiPath is onto something here.\n\nUiPath AI capabilities\n\nAt the conference, UiPath announced a number of new capabilities to extend its RPA Platform. But the key was the belief that AI and agentic programming are an extension of the existing platform. This is not unlike what we are seeing from ServiceNow or Salesforce. But my takeaway was that UiPath is different, in that its agent approach has a higher focus on enterprisewide agents versus the more personal or departmental approach we see in some other platforms. This viewpoint comes from three new capabilities.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\niOS 18.1.1—Update Now Warning Issued To All iPhone Users\n\nLeak Reveals Trump Crypto Bombshell As Bitcoin Suddenly Surges Toward $100,000 Price\n\nMatt Gaetz Controversy Explained: Sexual Misconduct Allegations Sink Trump’s Attorney General Nominee\n\nFirst, Agent Builder provides a more contextual and guided development experience. It is still low-code like other tools in this space, but there is a richer set of controls to guide the process. Think of it like a really good form to be filled out versus a blank sheet of paper. This context gives developers just enough structure for the supported workflows, integration points and access controls.\n\nSecond, Connector Builder helps with scale. The key to scaling agents will be similar to other non-AI applications in that the agent will need secure access to high-scale, cross-platform integration points. Connector Builder provides developers with an API-based integration hub that will enable a governed and manageable service for agentic applications.\n\nUiPath Connector Builder\nUiPath Community Blog\n\nThird, Autopilot for Everyone is a way for business users to create their own personal or departmental agents. One new concept of agentic programming that is not getting a lot of attention is that agents can use other agents or RPAs. This means more of a workflow assembly experience than a traditional process of application development. Too many platforms are treating the high-scale and personal agents separately, but I think that personal agents are just another onramp to get to enterprise agents. UiPath Autopilot provides users with the ability to create a personal agent that could invoke an enterprise agent as needed.\n\nComplementary, Not Competitive\n\nOver the past few months, we have seen many demos of an AI agent facilitating a business workflow, with the large language model behind it making most of the decisions along the way. This approach unquestionably has some utility, especially for processes with a degree of ambiguity such as granting an exception to pre-existing rules. It is also helpful for low-code and no-code development since some of the agents’ logic is delegated to the LLM—which makes agents easier to create and deploy.\n\nHowever, LLMs are not deterministic by nature. They tend to do better with ambiguity rather than set business rules. By contrast, RPA processes are built with the expectation of determinism. So, both types of applications will remain necessary for businesses, especially for higher-scale processes. In fact, an AI agent could invoke an RPA process—or vice versa—in cases that need both determinism and less-structured decisions, such as mortgage approval.\n\nAn Inspired And Motivated User Base\n\nThe reaction to UiPath’s announcements at the event was excitement. I spoke with multiple users who were considering how adding agents into their existing deployments could add value quickly. However, one of the more interesting conversations was with a user with an existing RPA that generated many exceptions requiring human handling. Her sense was that most of these exceptions were relatively simple to resolve, and that by adding an agent to handle the easier RPA exceptions, she could further reduce human touches. So, as I mentioned earlier, this is a case where an agent and an RPA could work collaboratively to increase velocity and quality.\n\nThe Value Of A Shared Platform\n\nIf we accept that both styles of process applications will remain viable for some time, we must also consider whether there is a way they can share services or infrastructure. This is where UiPath makes a solid case. Security, governance, workflow management and monitoring are all capabilities that have been in place within its RPA platform for some time. A unified RPA and agentic platform may appeal to enterprises that worry about issues such as application sprawl, increased attack surfaces and maximizing reuse. Importantly, these are all areas in which other platforms or general-purpose development tooling offerings that support agentic applications have caused some concern.\n\nThis is great news if you are an existing UiPath customer, since it will likely be easier for you to deploy and manage AI agents. Clearly, the existing users at the conference understood this. However, if you are not an existing customer, the new functionality does raise the same questions as other platforms that embed agentic capabilities such as Salesforce. For instance, will it require too much work or cost to deploy an entirely new platform only for creating agents—as opposed to simply building agents using general-purpose toolsets from one of the AI-aware hyperscalers such as AWS or IBM?\n\nKeeping What Works, Augmenting With What’s New\n\nAs someone who spends a great deal of time explaining new frontiers in AI application development, I was quite taken by the pragmatism of both UiPath and its users. All too often, new technology is represented as a replacement for something that already does a pretty good job as it is. UiPath’s approach, however, is to use something new (agents) to augment something that’s been working well for a long time (RPA). This means that agents are not regarded as either a threat or a panacea, but rather a catalyst to better apps and better enterprise processes.\n\nFor existing UiPath customers, getting started will be straightforward. However, UiPath may need to consider investing in more market education or deploying more aggressive sales methods to help new customers get on board. And that may be a great investment since UiPath’s vision speaks to both business value—starting in the short term—and to process evolution versus a disruptive revolution.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

        "summary": "",
        "text": "In the full-scale ethnic war between the Meiteis and the Kukis that Manipur has been witnessing since May 3, 2023, the one thing that has come as a surprise is that neither side has been hit by conflict fatigue although the blistering fight has entered its 18th month. In this period, around 250 people belonging to both communities have been killed and an estimated 60,000 displaced, who are now living in relief camps, many of them just makeshift facilities. If no side is willing to end the battle or have a dialogue, it means this is a turf war that Manipur is actually witnessing. The latest bout of violence was triggered by the brutal killing of a Hmar woman (Hmars belong to the Kuki-Zo ethnic group) in Manipur’s Jiribam district in the first week of this month. The Kukis were obviously agitated. On November 11, armed men, which the Manipur police described as “Kuki militants”, apparently attacked a CRPF post near Borobekra in Jiribam district. The CRPF men retaliated, and according to the Manipur police, the gunbattle continued for 45 minutes. A search of the area later led to the recovery of sophisticated weapons and 10 bodies of what the Manipur police said were “Kuki militants”. The same day, November 11, armed men had kidnapped a Meitei family whose home was in the shootout vicinity. The hostages were six people: three women and three children, including a 10-month-old infant. Five days later, on November 15, their bodies were picked up from a river in the area. All hell broke loose. On November 16, as soon as news trickled out of the six hostages being murdered, including the 10-month-old infant, women first gathered outside the iconic Ima Market in Imphal, a market run exclusively by women since the 16th century and a venue of many protests in Manipur’s capital. As the day progressed, Imphal was under the grip of thousands of protesters who started blaming the BJP-led government led by chief minister N. Biren Singh of having failed to protect lives and property. Soon, the mobs were on a rampage. They first attacked the residence of BJP MLA Imo Singh, who incidentally is the chief minister’s son-in-law. One after the other, the mob vandalised and burnt the homes of at least nine other ministers and MLAs, including the private residence of Mr Biren Singh. A woman MLA, S. Kebi Devi, was seen on television running on the street to escape a mob and hurriedly got into a bullet-proof police vehicle. For the first few hours on November 16, the state authorities clearly gave out an impression they were helpless as the mobs went unchallenged. Only late in the evening, the Manipur government brought the Meitei heartland, the Imphal Valley comprising five districts, under curfew and suspended Internet services. The Biren Singh government’s dilemma was clear -- at a time when the Kukis have been openly expressing their lack of faith and confidence in the Biren Singh government, the chief minister and his team in Imphal were in no position to antagonise their main support base, the Meiteis. By this time, the Centre, particularly the Union home ministry and home minister Amit Shah himself, had gone into a huddle over Manipur. A few quick fire-fighting measures were set in motion – the Centre dispatched 70 additional companies of paramilitary forces, and rushed the director-general of the CRPF and the GOC of the Army’s Dimapur-based 3 Corps to Manipur. In New Delhi, home minister Amit Shah reviewed the situation twice in 24 hours. But Mr Biren Singh and his alliance was facing the heat and pushed to the wall. One of the BJP’s key partners, the National People’s Party (NPP), withdrew support, leaving only the Naga People’s Front and the JD(U), besides a few Independents, with the coalition. NPP leader Conrad Sangma, the Meghalaya CM, shot off a blunt letter to BJP president J.P. Nadda saying that his party has lost confidence in Biren Singh’s leadership and that the NPP was deeply concerned about the situation in Manipur. The withdrawal of support by the seven NPP MLAs have had no impact on the Biren Singh ministry as it has the numbers, but the NPP pullout sent out a message that Biren Singh was losing the faith of many, including his allies. Biren Singh and his team had to come up with a response. The chief minister called a meeting of alliance MLAs on November 18 and adopted an eight-point resolution. The resolution amounted to Team Biren Singh giving a seven-day deadline to the Centre to launch a full-scale operation against “Kuki militants”, withdraw the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act from the six police station areas where it was reimposed recently, hand over the case related to the killing of the six Meitei hostages in Jiribam to the National Investigation Agency, and declaring the “Kuki militants” responsible for the killing of the six hostages as an unlawful organisation. The resolution recorded a veiled threat saying if the...",

I don't want to pretend that's not the case. I sometimes feel the tension that I will leave him behind.\n\n“And I would never have left him behind. I feel a tinge of disloyalty in living more life without him.”\n\nHe met his late husband after David approached Richard for advice on joining the clergy and although they soon developed romantic feelings for each other, they initially were not intimate with each other. \n\nAnd Coles retired from the clergy in 2022 because he felt he could no longer condone the way the Church of England \"doesn't treat people fairly\" in respect to its position on homosexuality.\n\nIn his memoir, The Madness of Grief, Richard wrote about living with someone in the grips of alcohol addiction and the \"paralysing\" period of sadness that followed.\n\nSpeaking to The Guardian in 2021, Rev Coles heartbreakingly admitted that he “neglected important things”.\n\nHe said: “I realised, suddenly, that in trying to fill my life with as much incident and interest as I could I had neglected important things of home and hearth. \n\n“I wish I’d spent more time with David. I wish I’d prioritised doing nothing with David more. Not seeing that as a holiday from things, but as the centre of things.\n\n“I think anyone who has shared their life with an addict, particularly someone who has died as a result of that addiction, you are beset by the various guilts that come with that. ‘Should I have done more?’ That thought pecks and pecks away at you.”\n\nRichard began dating again in 2023. Speaking about dating, Richard said last year: “I wanted to go on a website where I would meet someone who was not looking for a sugar daddy, who was my age, who lived in my sort of world, who I could share my life with.” \n\nThe pair met on dating site Elite Singles, a platform for people who are \"serious about dating\".\n\nOn entering the jungle, Rev Coles said: “I will miss my partner a lot and of those I have told, they all think it's hilarious I'm doing this. They have told me not to talk too much - especially first thing in the morning.”\n\nPartner Dickie Cant won't be flying to Australia to greet him because of work commitments. \n\nRev Richard will be joining N-Dubz star Tulisa, Loose Woman Jane Moore, professional dancer Oti Mabuse and many more stars in Australia to take part in ITV’s gruelling competition show.",

        "text": "There was a fire, and now there’s a firing.\n\nLast week there was a major blaze at the Set, the ultra-luxe apartment building in Hudson Yards owned by billionaire Miami Dolphins owner and development god Stephen Ross. \n\nNow Page Six hears that the 44-story building’s general manager has been sootcanned after management copped to problems with the way that it communicated with the well-heeled residents during the crisis.\n\nExecs have described the building as “a five-star hotel crossed with a luxury rental crossed with a techy workplace,” and, according to the New Yorker magazine, it offers amenities including “communal desks, Zoom rooms, concierges, housekeeping, I.V. drips, after-work drinks, fridge stocking and dry cleaning” plus a pool deck “for DJ parties.”\n\nBut last week the place caught the eyes of New Yorkers not so much for its envelope-pushing perks as the massive column of thick black smoke rising from its roof. \n\nApparently a fire started around 11am Thursday during maintenance on the building’s cooling tower. It was handled speedily, nobody was injured and we’re told that the building suffered no “residual damage.” According to ABC Eyewitness News, around 80 firefighters were on the scene.\n\nBut one resident told us that the building didn’t bother to mention the latest daring amenity — a pop-up rooftop conflagration — to residents.\n\n“There were no alarms, [at least] on the lower floor,” said one resident, who told us they found out about the fire only because they “noticed everyone in the windows [of the building across the street] looking up and pointing.”\n\nEven the group chat was spreading the hot goss before the building got around to making an announcement. “People were texting us that a building in on fire in Hudson Yards,” said our infernal insider, “and we are like, ‘We know — we are in it!“\n\nThe building later sent an email to residents about the “confusing” experience, saying that the communications during the fire “fell short.”\n\nThen on Wednesday it sent another message saying that “effective immediately” the building’s general manager is “no longer the general manager.”\n\nWe’re told that the protocol in high-rises is for people to stay in their apartments unless the fire is directly affecting the unit they’re in, so residents wouldn’t have been encouraged to leave even if there had been an alarm.\n\nRoss — who owns the Miami Dolphins and has a net some of some $10 billion — also built the famed Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle and the Gehry-designed Grand LA, and he has been at the forefront of the Hudson Yards development.\n\nIn July the Post reported that his firm, Related Companies, is planning a new Madison Avenue skyscraper.\n\nA rep for the building declined to comment on the firing.",

Given that unofficial versions of the album have circulated online for years and that releasing Balloonerism was something that Malcolm frequently expressed being important to him, we felt it most appropriate to present an official version of the project to the world. With that in mind, we're happy to announce that Balloonerism will be released on January 17th, 2025.\"\n\n \"The album was born from the same creative period in which Mac was working on Watching Movies with the Sound Off, Delusional Thomas, Faces and more, and represents the creative ambition that he had agnostic of musical genre,\" the family concluded.\n\n Alongside the album’s announcement, the Estate shared a trailer for the record’s accompanying film, which is directed by Samuel Mason.\n\n In the two-and-a-half-minute trailer, a series of animated vignettes are shown before the album cover appears on-screen.\n\n Balloonerism will be available digitally and in a variety of physical formats including CD, cassette and vinyl. Vinyl will be available as a two-LP release across two exclusive variants only available through balloonerism.com.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n Miller's family surprised fans by announcing that the Grammy-nominated hip-hop artist — who died of an accidental overdose in 2018 — had been working on a companion album to 2018's Swimming at the time of his death.\n\n In January 2020, with the help of close friend and fellow singer Jon Brion, Miller's \"final\" album Circles was released.",

        "text": "MONTREAL - Quebec’s auditor general says the province has taken little action in the past two decades to help Indigenous students in Quebec, whose graduation rates lag behind those of Indigenous students in other provinces.\n\nIn her report published Wednesday, Guylaine Leclerc says the Quebec government knew about a major gap in the success rates between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students since at least 2005, but failed to seriously address the issue.\n\nShe says that as of 2021, Quebec had the highest rate among the provinces of Indigenous people between the ages of 25 and 34 without a diploma or certificate.\n\nThe report also finds that Indigenous students in Quebec are given insufficient support, such as French-language training, when they transfer from schools in their communities to the province’s education system.\n\nLeclerc’s recommendations include that Quebec education officials define and implement indicators to improve Indigenous students’ success rates; train school staff on Indigenous realities; and develop culturally relevant learning environments.\n\nNeither the Quebec Education Department nor the Quebec minister responsible for First Nations and Inuit relations was immediately available for comment.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 21, 2024.",

        "summary": "Saturday's Lockerbie to Dumfries tractor and truck run is dedicated to Carolyne Muir who dies earlier this year",
        "text": "Hundreds of illuminated tractors and trucks are going on a fundraising road run on Saturday (November 23) to raise funds for the neonatal unit at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.\n\n They will snake their way from Lockerbie to Dumfries and back on an amazing fundraising marathon – the fourth to be held to help the special unit. The Christmas fun starts at the Harrison and Hetherington cattle mart in Lockerbie at 2.30pm where there will be raffles and tombola plus other prize games and everyone joining in with their vehicle lit up in Christmas decorations will pay £20 (cash only). There is no pre-booking – just turn up. Trophies will be awarded for the best decorated. \n\nThe vehicles leave the mart at 5.30pm for the journey to the hospital via Dumfries and back. They are expected to reach Whitesands around 6pm to 6.30pm, returning for 9pm. There will be Police Scotland and Dumfries and Galloway Blood Bikes in attendance.\n\nIt is again being organised again by dad-of-two, Ryan Muir and his wife Becky, of Johnstonebridge, who, earlier this year, handed over a magnificent £15,000 donation to delighted staff from last Christmas’ event, which has funded specialist equipment used to check jaundice levels in newborn babies specifically by community midwives when carrying out their checks on newborn babies at home.\n\nRyan – who was named on Saturday as the Bev Parish Community Person Of The Year and turned on Lockerbie’s Christmas lights – was inspired to help the ward where his daughter and niece were cared for when they were born prematurely.\n\nTheir daughter was born nine weeks early, and their niece thirteen weeks early, and it prompted them to start hold their first charity tractor run in 2020.\n\n Ryan revealed that both his parents, who gave their support with the two previous road runs, were both diagnosed with cancer in the weeks running up to last year’s fundraiser but the family staunchly carried on. Tragically, Carolyne Muir, died at the start of July and this year’s road run is in “her loving memory”.\n\nRyan said: “We are dedicating the run to our mum. She was a dedicated member of our cause for the neonatal where all proceeds raised will be going to help buy important equipment and training for the staff in the unit to help our little warriors. \n\n“Giving something back to the Neonatal Unit means a lot to us as they go above and beyond to help, not just the babies but their families too. We also want to help babies born early and their families as we remember what a really hard time it was for us.”\n\n As the vehicles will be moving slowly and in large numbers along the route, he said: “We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and noise levels. We will have a rolling road closure permit ( TTRO) in place. We are doing this for a very good cause but at the same time we are very mindful of local residents to try do this effectively and efficiently. “We advise anyone heading to work along this route to leave before the run starts or go the opposite way of the route to avoid being held back.” \n\nAnd he also spoke at his delight at Lockerbie’s community person of the year: “I am very grateful to received this and it has actually made me very emotional as this year is our first year without our mum, Carol, and it was one of our favourite events to do together.\n\n“I would like to thank everyone at Lockerbie Christmas Lights committee for choosing me. You guys did an amazing job filling the streets on Saturday with all the stalls full of entertainment for all to enjoy.”",

        "text": "Successive Israeli strikes pummelled Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold on Thursday as authorities said raids in eastern Lebanon killed 22 people, and Hezbollah claimed its deepest attack on Israel in more than a year of hostilities.Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) reported at least 12 strikes, some of them \"very violent\", on Beirut's southern suburbs throughout Thursday, targeting districts including Shiyah, Hadath and Haret Hreik, with a raid on the Kafaat neighbourhood destroying a building and damaging others nearby.The health ministry in separate statements said \"Israeli enemy\" strikes on five areas in east Lebanon's Baalbek region killed a total of 22 people, with the NNA reporting a strike on the village of Maqneh that left at least four members of the same family dead.Israeli first responders said a man was killed on Thursday after rocket fire from Lebanon hit the Galilee region in Israel's north.Israeli army spokesman Avichay Adraee on social media platform X issued several rounds of evacuation warnings for Beirut's southern suburbs, as well as areas in and around the southern coastal city of Tyre, where the NNA reported Israeli strikes. There were no warnings for east Lebanon.AFPTV footage showed columns of smoke rising from the southern suburbs, usually a densely populated residential district but now largely emptied.Adraee said on X that the Israeli military \"targeted a weapons depot, a command headquarters and terrorist infrastructure\" belonging to Hezbollah in south Beirut.Amid a series of attack claims, Hezbollah said its fighters targeted \"the Hatzor air base\" near Israel's southern city of Ashdod, around 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Lebanon's southern border, \"with a missile salvo\" -- its deepest target in more than a year of hostilities.In seven separate statements, Iran-backed Hezbollah said its fighters also targeted Israeli troops in and near the south Lebanon town of Khiam, including with artillery, rockets and drones.The NNA said \"the enemy army\" was \"blowing up homes and residential buildings during its incursion into the town\".Lebanon's official news agency and Hezbollah have reported fighting and air strikes in the Khiam area ever since Israeli ground troops first entered Lebanon on September 30, a week after Israel escalated its air raids against Hezbollah targets. The renewed Israeli strikes on Beirut's southern suburbs came after relative calm in the capital while United States envoy Amos Hochstein visited this week, seeking to broker an end to the almost two-month-long Israel-Hezbollah war.Lebanon's health ministry said Thursday that at least 3,583 people had been killed in the violence since October 2023.Most of the deaths have been since September this year.The Israeli military said Wednesday that three soldiers, including a 70-year-old, were killed in south Lebanon, bringing to 52 the number killed in Lebanon since the start of ground operations.",

He’s part of their success or lack of success. Brock Purdy is not playing like the quarterback we saw playing the last couple of years.”\n\nThe Packers meanwhile remain in the playoff hunt thanks to a dramatic win against the Chicago Bears in Week 11 by way of Cairo Santos’ blocked field goal.\n\nWhile Green Bay’s offense lies among the most explosive in the league, quarterback Jordan Love has faced heightened scrutiny having thrown 11 interceptions in eight games.\n\n“The mistakes Jordan Love is making now are the ones you think ‘that could end our season in January’,” said Neil Reynolds.\n\nLove has thrown at least one interception in every game he has played this season, while completing just 160 of 257 passes for 2,081 yards and 16 touchdowns after dazzling in his first full year as the starter in 2023.\n\n“He was phenomenal in the playoffs, improved all season long and went from strength to strength,” said Schecter. “This season has been chop and change for him.\n\n“He wouldn’t have expected as much of a fall back. He’s always been an aggressive style quarterback, that’s in his nature and he’ll take those shots, and with those shots, you sometimes get a 50/50 ball.\n\n“But the way and the rate he is turning the ball over is putting his team in such a negative position. If he continues to do this I don’t know how they continue to overcome it for the rest of the season.”\n\nClick on the link above to listen to the latest Inside the Huddle.

        "text": "A shocking discovery of a dead baby in Greater Manchester has left police and locals searching for answers. \n\nThe child, known only as ‘Baby A’, was found in a snow-covered field. Police are now appealing to the baby’s mum and dad to get in touch and also to members of the public who may know something about the tragic situation. \n\nDetails are currently limited, with the ethnicity and gender of the child not yet made public. Moved residents still left flowers for the tot, found in what one local has called a busy area. So what do we know?\n\nInvestigation ongoing\n\nAn investigation is ongoing. Cops do not yet know the gender, age or ethnicity of the infant. Police are working with a number of lines of enquiry. \n\nChief Superintendent Neil Blackwood said on Wednesday that an investigation will take time. \n\n\"Tragically, today, we have found what we believe to be the remains of a young baby on Ravenscraig Road in Salford,” he said. \n\n\"We have a scene in place, and you will likely see an increased presence of officers in the local area while we carry out enquiries to understand the circumstances.\"\n\nThe chief added: “The most important thing for us right now is to find answers for this baby and I would urge anyone who has any information at all to get in touch with us.\"\n\nChild found by busy road \n\nThe baby was found by a dog walker in a snow-covered field close to the M61 motorway bridge in Ashton Field, Salford. The remains were found at 12:30pm yesterday.\n\nLocal Michelle Eddison, 43, told The Sun: “This area is really popular with dog walkers and kids. It’s always busy during the day. We’ve walked our dog here many times. \n\n“There would be no time to leave a baby. This is a very busy road and the mother could be from anywhere really. The whole community is rattled, really shocked.” \n\nJulie Cooper, 45, added that the location of the discovery could mean someone drove there. “They could have come from anywhere,” she said.\n\nLocals stunned \n\nHorrified locals were moved to leave floral tributes at the site the child was found. Dawn Thompson, 31, was one of the people who visited the site.\n\nAttending with her baby daughter, just four months old, Dawn said: \"I’ve come to pay my respects to the little baby. I’ve got my own, so it hits a lot harder when you see something like this. \n\n“It’s horrible to know it was a baby and I feel sorry for the poor person whose found it. It made me cuddle my own baby a bit more. \n\n“We don’t know who the little baby’s family are.

U.S. bond yields, which influence Canadian bond yields, went up following the re-election of Donald Trump, as it signalled a pick-up in economic activity and inflationary spending, reigniting market concerns around inflation. The Bank of Canada policy rate currently sits at 3.75 per cent, after four consecutive cuts this year.\n\n“The Government of Canada 10-year bond yields — a benchmark proxy for longer term bond yields — has stayed around three and half per cent,” he said. “Which means that even though the Bank of Canada has been cutting interest rates, the long term bond yields that determine the market have remained around that three per cent.”\n\nCoStar Group, a real estate company that provides marketing services and analytics for property markets, released its 2025 outlook for Canada on Wednesday.

        "summary": "Kennedy, who made it to the Top 5 of season 19 before he was removed from the show, struck and killed a man in February 2022",
        "text": "Former American Idol contestant Caleb Kennedy has reportedly been sentenced on a felony DUI charge, nearly three years after he struck and killed a South Carolina father.\n\n Kennedy’s case was scheduled to go to trial, but he pleaded guilty on Monday, Nov. 18 to a felony driving under the influence charge resulting in death, according to The Greenville News and and FOX Carolina.\n\n He was sentenced to 25 years in prison and fined $25,100, though his sentence was reduced to eight years in prison, and his fine to $15,100, the outlets reported. Kennedy, 20, must also serve five years of probation and attend mental health and substance abuse counseling.\n\n Kennedy’s attorney did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment, nor did local authorities.\n\n The singer was 17 when his Ford pickup truck traveled 175 yards off the road and struck a garage in which 54-year-old Larry Duane Parris was working in Spartanburg, S.C. Parris was reportedly pronounced dead at the hospital three hours after the 12:30 p.m. crash.\n\n FOX Carolina reported that Kennedy’s defense said his dose of Prozac had been increased shortly before the crash, and The Greenville News reported he was driving under the influence of marijuana after using a vape pen, citing warrants. The warrants reportedly said Kennedy was on his way to his girlfriend’s house at the time of the accident, and that Parris was talking on a phone.\n\n \"A very good person died, and I feel so bad for the Parris family. Caleb's very remorseful and his heartfelt sympathies are extended to the Parris family. This sentencing starts the healing process for everybody involved in this situation,\" Kennedy’s attorney Ryan Beasley said in a statement to The Greenville News. “He’s got no record, and he was a minor when this happened. This wasn’t such an egregious act that you see most of the time, where people were drinking and driving then they hit somebody at night or going the wrong way down the road. This was a weird reaction from his prescription medicine and possibly THC.” \n\n In another statement to FOX Carolina, Beasley said that Kennedy “wants to express his heartfelt sympathies to the Parris family,” and that he “accepts his responsibility for this accident and hopes for healing for everyone affected by this tragedy.”\n\n Parris was the founder of the Parris Construction Company and was a member of New Beginnings Church, according to his obituary.\n\n Weeks after the crash, family including his wife Donna and daughter Kelsi gave an emotional plea during a virtual court hearing for Kennedy, asking the judge to deny him bond.\n\n \"I see my daddy laying in his own shop, moaning and groaning, with a stranger not even calling 911,\" Kelsi said, according to The State. \"He killed my dad, point-blank. I wish I could pay a little bit of money or a lot of money to have my daddy back.\"\n\n Kennedy competed on season 19 of American Idol in 2021, and made it to the Top 5. He was booted from the show after a controversial video of him hanging out with a friend who was wearing a hood similar to the ones worn by the Ku Klux Klan surfaced online.\n\n He later apologized, saying the video “displayed actions that were not meant to be taken in that way.”\n\n Three years of his sentence will be on home detention, according to The Greenville News. He will also receive credit for the nearly three years he has already served, which means he will likely serve about a year behind bars.",

        "summary": "Camagüey, Cuba, Nov 21 (Prensa Latina) Specialists and playwrights present at the Theatre Festival in this city today focused their debates on the figure of the puppet and the International Union of Puppets (Unima), based in Cuba.\n\n\nThe post Theatre Festival looks at the figure of the puppet in Cuba first appeared on Prensa Latina.",
        "text": "The presence of two greats of this section of stage, René Fernández and Maribel López, sparked dialogue among those attending the panel led by Yuddaly Favier, professor at the University of the Arts in Havana.\n\nThe specialist in Fundamentals of Children’s Theatre referred to the history of Unima, “the first NGO, which emerged in 1929 when puppeteers in the Czech Republic met for peace in the face of a war that was already looming.”\n\nFavier spoke about the changes, projections and revitalization of the Cuban puppet, “with a new stage that is being reborn and another that is already ending.”\n\nOn the subject, playwright Norge Espinosa warned of the need to involve the youngest, “so that Unima Cuba becomes that bridge of contact and reference again.”\n\n“In 2010, it was re-established on the map of the country, with those we could count on in Unima. And thanks to the power of convening and the intense work of Rubén Darío Salazar, it was growing again,” said the art critic.\n\nEspinosa said that the visit to Cuba of Manuel Morán, since 2016 president of the Commission of the Three Americas of the international Unima, fostered internal dialogue from Cuba and for the world.\n\n“Even in 2014 the World Council of Unima came to Matanzas; however, after the pandemic new mishaps have been suffered,” he said. Espinosa also warned about how through theater, particularly puppet theater, national culture can be strengthened.\n\n“Policy should be to bring us closer to that different sensitivity, a higher level. We must save culture in specific terms, put them in function of the guide of the immediate future. It is necessary to save everything that can be saved, in a country that has had artists of worth,” he concluded.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, Erduyn Maza (director of Teatro La Proa) and Arneldys Cejasla serve as president and general secretary of the Cuban Center of Unima, respectively.\n\nThe design of international workshops, meetings with specialists from Mexico, Colombia and South Korea have nuanced the work of Cuban puppeteers in recent months, a country that at the beginning of 2025 will participate in the International Unima Congress, which will be held in that Asian nation.",

        "summary": "The two California cross-country athletes and their parents are suing Riverside Unified School District over claims their protest was censored.",
        "text": "A California school told students who wore t-shirts protesting trans athletes that they were akin to wearing Nazi swastika, a lawsuit claims.\n\nRiverside Unified School District is being sued by two female Martin Luther King High cross-country runners and their parents over allegations their freedom of expression was infringed.\n\nThe girls, identified as ninth grader Kaitlyn and 11th grader Taylor, say they were rebuked over their shirts which bore the slogans, 'protect girls' sports' and 'It's Common Sense XX ≠ XY'.\n\nThe students decided to wear the shirts to a cross-country practice on November 1.\n\nIt came after a trans athlete was given Taylor's spot on the girl's varsity team despite allegedly not attending as many practices or putting in as much effort as Taylor, the filings state.\n\nThe student had recently transferred from another high school where she had broken its all-time record for girls' cross-country, according to the lawsuit.\n\nKaitlyn, 15, and Taylor, 16, allege they were told to remove the shirts by athletic director Amanda Chan as they created a 'hostile environment'.\n\n'School officials claimed the messages on Plaintiff's shirts created the same level of hostility as a student wearing a swastika in front of a Jewish student', the lawsuit states.\n\n'It hurt me really bad, because I am not a hateful person,' Taylor told Fox News Digital. 'God calls us to love everyone and be kind to everyone so just hearing that made me feel like I was being hateful to that person.\n\n'But I wasn't I was just standing up for women's sports and helping them get equality.'\n\n'It was definitely hurtful. We are in no way trying to be hateful we're just wearing a shirt that expresses what we believe in and trying to raise awareness to a situation,' Kaitlyn added.\n\n'It was not targeted to an individual at all, which the athletic director kept making it seem like it was.' \n\nThey also questioned why the school allows other political and religious messaging on campus, but took issue with the shirts which they claim other teammates supported them wearing.\n\nThe students state that their strong Christian convictions mean they believe, 'God created boys and girls with unique biological differences'.\n\n'In Plaintiffs' experiences, many of their teammates agree with their views of human identity, sex and gender but are afraid to express these views because of the social consequences of expressing a view that differs from the view promoted by authority figures within the school community,' the filing states.\n\nThe lawsuit, 'seeks to affirm Plaintiffs' right to express their views, ensure fair athletic opportunities for female students and hold the District accountable for discriminatory practices', according to the document.\n\nIt claims that the school's actions violated the teen's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as Title IX protection which prohibits exclusion on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs.\n\nTaylor and her father Ryan Starling say that she when she was ousted from the team she, 'missed opportunities to compete at a high-profile meet, losing valuable chances for college recruitment and recognition,' the lawsuit states.\n\n'This case is about more than two young athletes; it’s a stand for free speech, fair play, and the fundamental right of girls to compete on a level playing field without being sidelined by ideologies that disregard biological differences,' Nicole Velasco, spokeswoman at Advocates for Faith and Freedom, said.\n\nDailyMail.com has contacted the school district for comment.",

        "title": "Was it all joke? How stand-up comedy helped reelect Trump",
        "summary": "Donald Trump, in the weeks leading up to the election, engaged with a new breed of political influencers: right-leaning comedians with massive podcast followings. These comedians, while not explicitly endorsing Trump, targeted the \"woke left,\" echoing a key theme of his campaign.",
        "text": "Did stand-up comedians help reelect Donald Trump? Not a joke, as outgoing President Joe Biden might say. Trump has been the butt of countless late-night monologues and Saturday Night Live sketches for the better part of a decade, as much of Hollywood tracked the highs and lows of his political career with revulsion and ridicule. But in the weeks leading up to Election Day, he sat for interviews with podcasting comedians who occupy an increasingly popular space where political discourse is mediated through roast-style insults, right-leaning conspiracy theories and mockery of the left. They're all sort of simultaneously entertainers and influencers and pundits and - I've argued, propagandists - who have massive, loyal fanbases, said Seth Simons, a journalist who writes a newsletter about the comedy industry's darker side. The Trump era has coincided with the rise of the hourlong Netflix special and comedy podcast. And while the world of stand-up is as diverse as the nation itself, some of its hottest acts have punched left. Dave Chappelle has repeatedly courted controversy by mocking transgender activists. Bill Burr has roasted feminists with relish, most recently in his post-election SNL monologue ( All right, ladies, you're 0-2 against this guy ). Even Michelle Wolf, who famously roasted Trump at the 2018 White House Correspondents Dinner, has an extended riff in her 2022 special critiquing #MeToo, calling it the worst-run movement I've ever seen . None of these comics publicly supported Trump, but nonetheless trained their fire on the so-called woke left, a bogeyman of Trump's campaign. Trump got a warm welcome - but not everyone was amused That's what seems to have brought Trump, a veteran TV entertainer himself, into the studios of Joe Rogan, the nation's most listened-to podcaster, and other comedians. He discussed addiction and the opioid crisis with Theo Von, who told the past and future president that cocaine will turn you into a damn owl, homie . On another podcast, Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh laughed out loud as Trump went through his nicknames for political rivals - like Comrade Kamala Harris - and recounted his near-assassination. Politicians have long sought to reach voters on alternative platforms. Former President Barack Obama slow jammed the news with Jimmy Fallon, who ruffled Trump's hair in 2016. Both Obama and Hillary Clinton appeared on Zach Galifianakis' web series Between Two Ferns. Harris appeared on SNL days before the election and sat with an array of more earnest podcasters, with less evident success. For Trump, the podcasts were part of a larger effort to reach young male voters - a tactic he says his son Barron, 18, suggested. More than half of male voters ages 18-44 supported Trump, and 45 per cent supported Harris, although Biden won this group in 2020, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters. While politicians' late-night appearances tend to be carefully scripted affairs, Rogan interviewed Trump for a whopping three hours in a conversation that veered from false claims about the 2020 election to speculation about UFOs and John F. Kennedy's assassination. Rogan, who supported Bernie Sanders in 2020, subsequently endorsed Trump this cycle. Trump's interviewers aren't political comedians; they're just as likely to chat about internet curiosities, mixed martial arts or weightlifting. Their views seem primarily rooted in suspicion of the establishment, devotion to free speech and openness to alternative - and often unfounded - theories about things like vaccines and immigration. That may have led them to see Trump as a kindred spirit. The rebels are Republicans now. You want to be a rebel, you want to be punk rock, you want to like buck the system, you're a conservative now, Rogan said during the interview, which has nearly 50 million views on YouTube. Simons says Rogan and his acolytes, consciously or not, have shifted what's acceptable in comedy rightward. The relationship that people have with these roast comics, these comics who tell racist jokes or sexist jokes, is that they don't mean what they say, it's just funny, Simons said. Marc Maron, whose podcast WTF helped birth the genre, called out his fellow comics in a blog post after the Rogan interview. The anti-woke flank of the new fascism is being driven almost exclusively by comics, my peers, Maron wrote. When comedians with podcasts have shameless, self-proclaimed white supremacists and fascists on their show to joke around like they are just entertainers or even just politicians, all it does is humanize and normalize fascism. A fractured media landscape It wasn't always like this. Johnny Carson, the king of late night for three decades until his 1992 retirement, steered clear of political controversies to cultivate a mass audience. This was also when most Americans got their news from the Big Three television networks. Fast forward to today: Left-leaning hosts of comedy shows across many channels deliver nightly polemics interspersed with news clips. To their critics, comedians like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and John Oliver are indistinguishable from MSNBC commentators. Comedian Wayne Federman, the author of a history of stand-up, says these hosts can only draw a fraction of Carson's viewers, removing the economic incentive to appeal widely. As most late-night hosts seemed openly aligned with (the Democratic National Committee), a market niche opened in the podcast space. Enter Joe Rogan, he said. Rogan's show, for which he landed an estimated USD 250 million deal with Spotify, has become a springboard for up-and-coming comics. For a lot of comedians right now, following in Joe Rogan's footsteps and trying to be in his world and emulate him is a smart career move, Simons said. I think that's partly why there are so many Andrew Schulzes and Theo Vons. Presidential candidate or insult comic? Beyond his podcast appearances, Trump may have benefited more subtly from stand-up's proliferation. Much was made of Trump's extemporaneous speaking style - what he referred to as the weave - in which his hourlong speeches meandered through stories, digressions, movie references and obscenities. As political speech, it was unconventional, but it bore many of stand-up's hallmarks: deliberate provocations, trademark punchlines and callbacks eventually wrapping it all together. Because some of the things he says seem like they're so off-centre, people take it as a joke, said Shilpa Dave, a University of Virginia professor of media studies. The kind of comedy that he's doing doesn't come off as threatening, it comes off as acceptable. It also posed problems for journalists covering his speeches: When he said he would be a dictator for a day, or inveighed against enemies from within, or promised to round up and deport millions of immigrants in the US without authorisation, was he laying out policies or joking around? You can first denounce what journalists do by having called everything they say fake news,' and then you can denounce what they expose by saying they just don't get it - the stand-up comedy defence, said Robert Thompson, a professor of television and popular culture at Syracuse University. There were times when the jokes didn't land - but they weren't his. Trump faced outrage after Tony Hinchcliffe, another comedian with a roast-style podcast, referred to Puerto Rico as a floating island of garbage and made other racist jokes at a rally. The campaign distanced itself from Hinchcliffe as Puerto Rican celebrities backed Harris and commentators wondered if it would turn off Latino voters. Imagine bombing so hard you save america from fascism, comedian Zack Bornstein posted on X. But barely a week later, it was Trump who brought the house down.",

        "summary": "The Centre in its recent order to States, and Union Territories warned that air pollution is a significant contributor to acute health conditions. It has asked them to initiate measures to ensure preparedness in view of the deteriorating air quality across northern India, with the onset of winters, and its adverse impact on people’s health ",
        "text": "The combination of festive activities and the onset of winter have further deteriorated the Air Quality Index (AQI) in certain States and Union Territories across India forcing the Union Health Ministry to issue an advisory directing state health departments and healthcare facilities to enhance their preparedness to safeguard the health of public against the ill-effects of rising air pollution levels.\n\nRecently, the Ministry has said that people should limit outdoor activities including early morning/late evening sports and walking (particularly the elderly and vulnerable groups, including pregnant women, children, and those working outdoors like traffic police officers).\n\nThe Central government in its recent order to State and Union Territories warned that air pollution is a significant contributor to acute health conditions and exacerbates the progression of related chronic diseases. It has asked them to initiate measures to ensure preparedness in view of the deteriorating air quality across northern India, with the onset of winters, and its adverse impact on people’s health.\n\nThe letter from the Centre has directed that public awareness campaigns using regional languages through mass media be pressed into action and has also called for strengthening the healthcare workforce and increasing participation in sentinel surveillance for air pollution-related diseases. Weather experts have noted that air quality in the National Capital is currently in the ‘very poor’ category with hospitals registering a rise in the number of patients coming in with adverse respiratory symptoms.\n\nIn his letter, Director General of Health Services Atul Goel said that the adverse effects of air pollution are “particularly severe” for vulnerable groups. Stating that chronic illnesses, attributed to prolonged exposure to air pollution, often lead to an increase in premature mortality, the letter said that there is a need to ensure “enhanced preparedness.”\n\nThe Central government has sought to discourage stubble and waste burning, promoting the use of public transportation, limiting reliance on diesel-based generators etc.\n\nAlso, individuals have been advised to minimise their exposure to polluted air by monitoring air quality indices through government mobile applications before venturing outdoors, avoiding heavily congested areas, and opting for cleaner fuels at home for cooking, heating, and lighting.\n\nThe Capital and its nearby area along with other regions of the country have been witnessing an alarming rise in pollution levels with the Delhi-NCR Air Quality Index (AIX) hovering around 300-400 range and has even gone up to over 500.\n\nExperts said, in the month of October and on the onset of winter, they have been witnessing nearly 40% spike in the cases of cardio and respiratory problems including asthma, triggered by high levels of pollution. The World Heart Federation’s (WHF) World Heart Report 2024, indicated alarming statistics on the relationship between air pollution and cardiovascular disease (CVD) globally. In India, a country already burdened with a high prevalence of CVDs, the impact of environmental factors, particularly air pollution, poses a significant public health challenge. \n\nExperts are now calling for urgent attention and action to address these environmental triggers of CVDs. Indian cardiologists and public health professionals emphasise that without addressing pollution, tackling cardiovascular health challenges will remain an uphill battle.\n\nEmphasising the clinical mechanisms through which pollution impacts heart health, Faraz Ahmed Farooqui, consultant- Cardiology, at PSRI Hospital, said that long-term exposure to air pollution leads to endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress, both of which are critical precursors to cardiovascular diseases.\n\n“In India, the incidence of conditions such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure has seen a marked increase in polluted areas. These pollutants not only increase blood pressure but also trigger inflammatory responses in the blood vessels, accelerating atherosclerosis, which further heightens the risk of heart attacks and strokes,” he said.\n\nThe World Heart Report also highlights how particulate matter from agricultural practices, particularly residue burning in North India, significantly impacts air quality. The plumes from burning crop stubble contribute to spikes in particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), aggravating the cardiovascular health of millions . Praveen Gupta, principal director & chief of Neurology, at Fortis Hospital, added that pollution causes a significant impact on human health.\n\n“It can exacerbate respiratory problems such as COPD and asthma. It increases the risk of heart disease besides being the major cause of cancer. It is also a leading risk factor for stroke, cognitive impairment, and dementia. Pollution has a negative influence on mental health, producing loss of focus, irritation, and brain fog. There is mounting evidence that exposure to air pollution increases the risk of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Poor air quality has a substantial impact on our mental health, increasing the risk of anxiety and depression,” he said.\n\nThe primary causes of this heightened risk include traffic exhaust fumes, home wood burning, and elevated levels of nitrogen dioxide, which can be ascribed to industrial emissions, gardening equipment, power plants, and construction and exhaust fumes.\n\nExperts are now advocating for steps to decrease air pollution in their communities, such as utilizing public transportation wherever feasible, reducing the use of wood and coal in the house, repairing cars on a regular basis, and inspecting tyres often.``We may also avoid being exposed to high levels of air pollution by limiting the amount of time we spend in regions with high amounts of traffic or other pollutants, as well as using filtration systems to keep the air in our homes pure,” Dr. Gupta added. He warned that household air pollution is associated with increased mortality from ischemic heart disease and stroke, with women and children in rural areas being particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), notes that air pollution can cause a variety of health issues including -- cardiovascular disease (strokes and heart disease), respiratory disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory infections, and asthma), cancer (lung cancer), preterm and low-birthweight, cognitive and neurological impairment.\n\nAir pollution is a major environmental health problem that affects people in all income levels. In 2019, the WHO estimated that 4.2 million people died prematurely due to outdoor air pollution. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected by air pollution, with 89% of premature deaths occurring in these areas. Air pollution is the second leading cause of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) globally after tobacco.\n\n ``Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas is causing fine particulate matter which results in strokes, heart diseases, lung cancer, and acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Additionally, around 2.6 billion people are exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution from using polluting open fires or simple stoves for cooking fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal,’’ notes the WHO. It adds that air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.\n\nHousehold combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. \n\nWHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guidelines limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. Air quality is also closely linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally.)",

        "text": "Veteran director and producer Robert Rippberger has relaunched Ascent Studios in North Carolina as White Lightning Studios, with new investment partners. \n\n Rippberger’s new investors for the rebrand include former National Football League star Jason Brown, who currently runs the food relief non-profit First Fruit Farms and has land contiguous with the film complex. Ascent Studios, which broke ground in 2023 and has now opened, has six soundstages spread over 170,000 square feet and in all around 200 acres of land.\n\n Rippberger’s rebranded venture also has backing and investment from North Carolina-originated producer and actress Kelly Lynn Reiter (Deadlock, Laws of Man, The Cut), and Roger Goff as general counsel.\n\n White Lightning Studios has already lined up its first feature, A Good Fight, a heartfelt comedy written by Pierce Gardner and to be directed by Rippberger. The project is produced by Justin Shaner and Fernando H. Rojas of Miami’s Sobe Brooke Studios and follows a successful small-town businessman whose interview with an intrusive college newspaper reporter spins out of control, and turns both their lives around. \n\n Rippberger directed the Frankie Muniz-led sci-fi/thriller Renner in North Carolina in 2023. The film is set for an early-2025 release.\n\n In a statement, Rippberger cited filmmakers taking advantage of North Carolina’s 25 percent tax rebate to lure film and TV projects to his stages in the triangle regions of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.\n\n “Nowhere else will you be able to get as much production value with as good of a state tax incentive. This is a studio team of professionals whose expertise is bringing TV, film, commercials, and music videos to life, and with a bit of Southern charm,” he said.\n\n Rippberger recently directed the Frankie Muniz led sci-fi/thriller Renner in North Carolina, which is set to release early 2025. His credits include the Booboo Stewart led horror/thriller Those Who Walk Away, the drama Strive, starring Danny Glover, and producing the documentary How To Build a Truth Engine, executive produced by George Clooney and Grant Heslov, which had a world premiere at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival. \n\n Rippberger is repped by Established Artists and Millennial PR.",

        "text": "Oyo governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde has assured that thousands of jobs would be created through Agribusiness for Ibarapa youths.\n\nThis is as he assured speedy completion of the ongoing Ido-Eruwa road.\n\nMakinde disclosed this at the ground-breaking ceremony of the upgrade of moribund 3,250 hectares Eruwa Farm Settlement to an Agribusiness Industrial Hub in Eruwa on Thursday.\n\nThe governor said that the project, once completed, would put Ibarapaland on the global agricultural map and create thousands of jobs for youths in the zone and across the state.\n\nHe added that his administration would also complete the Ido-Eruwa Road within the next one year, charging residents of Ibarapa zone to make investors feel welcome, when the new agribusiness hub is completed.\n\nHe noted that the government recently approved the release of a tranche of N2 billion to the contractor handling the road project so as to fast-track its progress.\n\nAccording to the governor, the administration established the Oyo State Agribusiness Development Agency (OYSADA) as a special purpose vehicle to drive agribusiness in the state and that so far, the state has achieved great successes and gone ahead to become a model for other states, and even some African countries, in the area of agribusiness.\n\nHe equally expressed the confidence that the new Agribusiness Hub in Eruwa would also be a success story like the Fasola Agribusiness Hub, as, according to him, development partners and investors, who have already committed to bringing in their money to the facility, were present at the ground-breaking ceremony.\n\nHe said: “About five years ago, we started what I will call the journey to make agribusiness the driver of Oyo State’s economy. Immediately we came into office, we got access to a N7.6 billion loan facility taken by the previous administration and our plan was to use this loan to ensure that two of our moribund farm settlements are converted to agribusiness hubs.\n\n“So, we started a pilot project at the moribund Fasola Farm Settlement, which we picked to serve as a prototype. It was an ambitious project, because no state in Nigeria had ever done that.\n\n“At first, we thought it would take like a year to complete the pilot project at Fasola, which is about 1,000 hectares. By calculation, it is bigger than Victoria Island in Lagos. Eruwa Farm Settlement is three times bigger than Fashola and what you see in the new Fasola Agribusiness Hub today is what we are putting up here.\n\n“Fashola has taught us a very big lesson and we know that we have the capacity to take on this project and to see it to completion.\n\n“As of today, it is not only that all states in Nigeria have come to inspect Fasola; we have had officials from Ogun, Ekiti, Cross River, Borno, Plateau, Delta, Bayelsa and Gombe states. We have also had visitors from outside Nigeria, including Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Mozambique and Kenya.\n\n“So, I want to say to the people of Ibarapaland that you should be ready, because Ibarapaland is now on the agriculture map.\n\n“We are quite happy and, as for me, I feel fulfilled that this journey to develop this farm estate is getting done.\n\n“I am happy to be joined on this journey by development partners and the private sector. Some of the people seated here today have committed to bring their money to invest in this environment.\n“My people in Ibarapa; what you can do for me is to make the investors feel welcome. Support them and they will create jobs for our youths.”\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Director-General of OYSADA, Dr Debo Akande, said that the Eruwa Agribusiness Hub is expected to be a 40-million-dollar public-private development investment that will change the agricultural landscape of Eruwa, Ibarapa, and Oyo State.\n\n“This facility will include a crop and livestock production centre, 15-20 processing centres, a state-of-the-art agribusiness training centre, a mechanisation and equipment leasing centre, an early-generation seed production centre, and, the icing on the cake will be an eco-resort centre that will put Eruwa on the world map.\n\n“I thank His Excellency for his visionary leadership, the citizens of Oyo State, the good people of Ibarapa, and particularly Eruwa, the private investors, and AfDB for believing in this.”\n\nExplaining how Fasola Hub has become a success story, Akande maintained that the Hub has seen an influx of 12 medium to large national and international private companies occupying the 1,150 hectares of land for crop production, livestock rearing, and processing for domestic consumption and export.\n\nHe added that these companies have been contributing to supporting smallholder farmers in the state through training, taking their crops for processing and development of early generation seeds that will help yields across the state.\n\nIn his special remarks, Director-General, Nigeria, African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr Abdul Kamara, lauded Governor Makinde for resuscitating moribund farm settlements and putting the state on the path of agribusiness, which he described as consistent with AfDB’s approach to rural and economic transformation and aligns with its focus to feed Africa, guarantee food security, nutrition, agro-processing, agricultural transformations, industrialisation and improving the quality of lives for Africans.\n\nHe assured that the AfDB would give its maximum support to the speedy execution of the project.\n\nIn their separate goodwill messages, the Senior Special Adviser on Industrialisation to the President of AfDB, Prof. Banji Oyeleran-Oyeyinka; the Olu of Igbooro, Oba Olajide Titiloye; and the chairman, Eruwa Council of Elders, Chief Joseph Peluola, severally appreciated Governor Makinde for seeing the future of agriculture sector and making the project a reality.\nThey urged the governor to ensure the speedy completion of the Ido-Eruwa road and equally enhance microfinance banks to give financial support to more farmers.\n\nDelivering a vote of thanks, the Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Adebo Ogundoyin, equally lauded Governor Makinde, noting that the Eruwa Agribusiness Industrial Hub would be a legacy project for him after his tenure.\nHe also charged residents of the area to cooperate with the contractors for the success of the project.\n\nThe event had in attendance former deputy governors of Oyo State, Engr. Hamid Gbadamosi and Alhaji Hazim Gborlarumi; Chief Judge of Oyo State, Hon. Justice Iyabo Yerima, former Speaker of the House of Assembly, Senator Monsurat Sumonu; and Chairman of the House of Assembly Committee on Agriculture, Hon.

        "text": "Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has expressed joy following the arrest of Simon Ekpa by Finnish police, saying it marks a significant milestone in the collective journey towards healing and reconciliation.\n\nOhanaeze disclosed this in a statement signed by its Secretary General Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro on Thursday.\n\nAccording to the statement, the arrest marks a significant milestone in the collective journey towards healing and reconciliation as they stand firm in their resolve to advocate for a peaceful, prosperous Southeast and a united Nigeria, where the voices of all citizens are valued and respected.\n\nThe statement reads “The Apex Igbo Sociocultural Organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, takes this momentous occasion to announce our unequivocal relief and support in light of the recent arrest of Simon Njoku Ekpa, the self-proclaimed leader of the Biafran independence movement. The ramifications of this event, executed by the District Court of Päijät-Hame in Finland, are monumental and expected to resolve the pervasive insecurity challenges that have beleaguered Southeastern Nigeria for far too long.\n\n“Ekpa has been remanded in custody on serious charges of public incitement to commit crimes with terrorist intent. His tumultuous ambition to publicly declare a Sovereign Biafra Nation—a scheme set to take shape on December 2, 2024—was not only misguided but indicative of a reckless disregard for the profound consequences such a declaration would evoke. His intentions could have sparked uncontrollable civil unrest and perhaps culminated in another Biafran War, a prospect that the Igbo people have conclusively rejected and remain unprepared to engage in. The echoes of the previous conflict, which left indelible scars on our history, stand as a stark reminder of the devastation war brings.\n\n“Upon this crucial arrest, Ohanaeze Ndigbo categorically denounces the notion that individuals like Simon Ekpa possess the capability or legitimacy to summon the Igbo Nation into a conflict. This organization acknowledges Ekpa’s disturbing record over the last three years, wherein he has systematically wreaked havoc upon the very fabric of our society and economy, implementing his illegitimate Monday Sit-At-Home directive with the aid of armed men who have terrorized our communities. The financial toll from these activities is staggering, amounting to a loss of over 22 trillion naira in investment opportunities, thereby stifling the economic viability of our region.\n\n“There is a pervasive atmosphere of relief permeating across the 95 Local Government Areas of Southeastern Nigeria since the announcement of Ekpa’s arrest. The collective silence that now blankets our communities speaks volumes about the anticipation that his detention may sever ties to his alleged sponsorship of terrorism that has spiralled into our region. The citizens, long traumatized by the unchecked terror he and his followers unleashed, are hopeful that the Finnish authorities’ decisive action represents a critical juncture in restoring peace and stability.\n\n“Ohanaeze Ndigbo is compelled to express its longstanding suspicions regarding the Finnish government’s inaction regarding Simon Ekpa’s activities over the past three years. As a Finnish citizen, he exploited the freedoms offered within that society to orchestrate broadcasts that incited violence and animosity against the very nation in which he resides. It is a matter of profound concern for all of us that mercenaries, veiled as agitators, infringe upon our quest for peace while undermining our autonomy.\n\n“The Secretary-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, articulates that this organization is deeply disturbed by the violent disruptions wrought by Simon Ekpa and his cohorts over the past three years. Our aspirations are clear: the Ndigbo people seek a restructured Nigeria that fosters peace, dialogue, and development, rather than retracing steps towards conflict. We do not share any sympathies towards Ekpa’s current predicament; rather, we are resolute in our commitment to safeguarding the aspirations of our people.\n\n“As we look toward December 2, 2024, we urge the Finnish Government and relevant international bodies to act swiftly and decisively. We expect continued vigilance and actions that ensure no further endeavours like Ekpa’s are permitted to disrupt our fragile peace.\n\n“Let this be a clarion call for unity, peace, and collective progress as we embark on a new chapter, free from the shadows of violence and discord.”\n\nALSO READ FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE \n\nFinnish police arrest Simon Ekpa over terrorism charges\n\n\r\n\r\nGet real-time news updates from Tribune Online!

        "text": "Samaj Parvarthan Samudaya (SPS), Jan Sangram Parishat (JSP), National Committee for Protection of Natural Resources (NCPNR) and other organisations have urged Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his Cabinet colleagues to drop the proposal for allowing round the clock mining activities in the State.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Chief Minister, Minister for Forest, Environment and Ecology Eshwar Khandre and Minister for Mines and Geology S.S. Mallikarjun, founder-president of SPS S.R. Hiremath has urged them to not to allow 24 x 7 mining activities, including transportation of iron and manganese ore in Ballari, Sandur and Hosapete.\n\nMr. Hiremath has said that the areas in which round the clock mining is being proposed are treasure trove of biodiversity and if allowed, it will cause irreparable damage to the ecosystem.\n\n“The higher altitude of Sandur plays a vital role in the distribution of flora and fauna of this region. Rare trees of higher commercial value like red sanders, sandalwood, rosewood and teak wood are grown in some parts of Sandur hills. The faunal diversity is also different compared to the rest of the eastern plains of Karnataka. Some birds of the Western Ghats like the Red-whiskered Bulbul, White Eye, Red Spur-fowl, Puff-throated Babbler, Brown-headed Barbet are also seen in Sandur hills. It is observed that the forest cover in Sandur area has different endemic wildlife species,” he has said in the letter.\n\n“Wild animals such as Indian sloth bear, leopard, four-horned antelope, jackal, fox, wild boar, jungle cat, Asian palm civet, Black-naped hare, common mongoose are reported seen in the forests area. A repertoire of birds, reptiles, butterflies is also found,” he has said.\n\nMr. Hiremath has said that the present system of allowing mining activity between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. has helped the ecosystem to heal its wounds. “The wildlife moves out of its hideouts during the night and the nocturnal animals roam around the forest in the mining areas for food and water. But the government’s contemplation on allowing mining activities in the night will definitely destroy the entire ecosystem and increase man-animal conflicts,” he has said.\n\n“Allowing mining round the clock will affect the nocturnal movement of the wild animals, including leopards, sloth bear, wild boars, four-horned antelopes and increase the risk of them being mowed down by heavy vehicles at night. It will also drive away the wild animals from the forest forcing them to stray into human habitats thus increasing further man-animal conflict,” he has said.\n\nMr. Hiremath has also pointed out that the dust from mining activities has resulted in diseases such as bronchitis, asthma and silicosis. “Increased dust will also affect crops and fruit-bearing plants leading to reduction in yield and thereby, the income of farmers,” he has said, urging the Chief Minister not to allow round the clock mining activities.\n\nThe letter is signed by office-bearers of various like-minded organisations.",

This book seeks to unpack his complex leadership style, his transition from revolutionary populism to elected governance, and the implications of his policies for Ghana’s development,” he remarked.\n\nScholarship\n\nHe explained that the book is his first major work on Ghana’s politics. He said it is an updated and expanded version of his unpublished 1988 PhD thesis titled Rawlings and the Politics of Development Policy in Ghana, 1979–86.\n\nHe further revealed that during the 1990s and early 2000s, he published research findings on Rawlings and the PNDC in several prestigious international peer-reviewed journals, including African Affairs, Commonwealth and Comparative Politics, Journal of Contemporary African Studies, Journal of Modern African Studies, and Review of African Political Economy.\n\nHe said the book also recounts Rawlings’ return to multi-party democracy in late 1992 and his ten years as an elected President. He added that it assesses Rawlings’ political legacy following his death in 2020. Professor Haynes noted that the book has been a long journey, spanning 40 years of research. He shared that it is informed by 125 personal interviews conducted over several decades.\n\n“The book has four objectives. First, I seek to contextualize Rawlings’ initial revolutionary populism in contemporaneous radical military interventions in Africa. The second is to outline the characteristics and political consequences of Rawlings’ revolutionary populism and authoritarian populism which replaced it.\n\nThe third is to examine the return to multi-party democracy in late 1992 and the following 10 years of Rawlings rule as elected president. The fourth objective is to assess Rawlings political legacy in Ghana following his death in November 2020,” Prof. Haynes stated.\n\nUnparalleled\n\nBright Philip Donkor, News Editor of the Daily Statesman and Founder of the Briphildon Foundation, hailed the as a transformative work that provides unparalleled insight into Ghana’s political landscape during the Rawlings era.\n\nSpeaking as the reviewer at the book’s launch, Donkor lauded the publication for its depth, clarity, and ability to address the multifaceted legacy of the late former President Jerry John Rawlings.\n\n“Upon my first reading of the review copy during my leisure time, I immediately recognized its vast potential for intellectual stimulation. It is that very fact that makes this book such a valuable and worthwhile publication. Reading it is like savoring a rare breed of sweet wine—its taste lingers and leaves you wanting more,” Donkor stated.\n\nDonkor noted that the book effectively tackles lingering questions about Rawlings’ political ideology, the influence of his governance on Ghana’s democratic evolution, and the impact of his policies on national institutions. He highlighted that while the book is not an autobiography, it sheds unparalleled light on the Rawlings era and its contributions to Ghana’s political trajectory.\n\n“The publication of this book is a significant event. Despite the vibrancy of Rawlings’ nearly two decades of rule, that period remains relatively opaque in our history. Prof. Haynes has illuminated this transformative era in a manner unmatched by other works,” he stressed.\n\nPersonal transformation\n\nReflecting on his reading experience, Donkor shared how the book reshaped his understanding of Ghanaian politics. “Before diving into this text, my perspective on Rawlings was largely shaped by popular narratives and media portrayals,” he admitted. “However, the author’s meticulous research and nuanced analysis provided me with a richer, more complex view of Rawlings’ impact. I came to appreciate not only the ideological shifts during Rawlings’ tenure but also the intricate interplay between revolutionary fervor and the pragmatic challenges of governance.”\n\nHe particularly commended Prof. Haynes for addressing controversial topics such as the murder of judges and economic reforms, which challenged his previously simplistic views. Donkor added that the detailed exploration of how Rawlings’ regime navigated international pressures and internal power struggles offered new insights into the broader political context of the time.\n\n“The book has helped me understand the legacy of Rawlings’ policies, particularly their role in shaping Ghana’s transition towards a more democratic and market-oriented society,” he noted.\n\nDonkor emphasized that the book’s succinctly defined scope belies its comprehensive contribution to understanding Ghana’s recent political developments. He outlined four key aspects that make the book an essential read.\n\nHe observed that Rawlings is often regarded as both an enigma and a contradiction. Prof. Haynes skillfully illustrates how Rawlings and his close associates navigated a revolutionary period that began without a clear roadmap.\n\nWhile Rawlings has been a subject of academic research for decades, this book, Donkor argued, is a must-read for a wide audience, including historians, researchers, ordinary citizens, and particularly the youth. “It reminds us not to take our democratic journey and experience for granted,” he said.\n\nDonkor praised the depth of Prof. Haynes’ research, which included interviews with individuals who worked closely with Rawlings during his political career, from his early days in 1979 to his presidency from 1992 to 2001.\n\n“Finally, the book stands out as a crucial work for anyone interested in the evolution of Ghanaian politics. It provides a thorough examination of Rawlings’ impact on Ghana’s democratic development, combining rigorous research with insightful analysis,” he stated.\n\nHe further recommended the book to all segments of the population, including academics, politicians, and the business community. “This masterpiece is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of Ghana’s political journey and the indelible mark left by Jerry John Rawlings,” he affirmed.\n\nCommendation\n\nDr Dede Amanor-Wilks, Economist Development Specialist, who was the Chairperson for the launch, commended Professor Jeffrey Haynes for his remarkable work in documenting the political legacy of Ghana’s former President Jerry John Rawlings.\n\nIn her remarks, Dr. Amanor-Wilks described the book as a highly accessible and insightful read that offers a well-rounded analysis of Rawlings’ transformative leadership during his two-decade tenure.\n\n“The book is easy to read, and Prof. Haynes has done a fantastic job in presenting complex political and economic issues in a manner that resonates with a wide audience,” she said.\n\nShe emphasized the importance of the book as a resource for understanding Ghana’s contemporary political history. She noted that the author’s nuanced approach not only captures the pivotal moments of Rawlings’ leadership but also evaluates his enduring impact on Ghana’s democratic and economic trajectory.\n\nRecommending the book to a diverse audience, Dr. Amanor-Wilks highlighted its value for scholars, students, policymakers, and the general public. “This is a must-read for anyone interested in Ghana’s political evolution and the role of leadership in shaping national development,” she stated.\n\nShe underscored how the book’s critical approach balances Rawlings’ achievements with his challenges, providing readers with a holistic perspective of his leadership.\n\n“Prof. Haynes’ ability to distill such a complex and polarizing legacy into an engaging narrative is a testament to his scholarly excellence. He has not only documented history but has also created a platform for future discourse on leadership and governance in Africa,” she indicated.",

        "summary": "The 5.4 kilometre route will help to better connect Newtownards with Bangor",
        "text": "Work on the ground for the new Newtownards to Bangor greenway has started.\n\nThe new greenway includes three and four metre-wide paths, pedestrian/cycle railing, fencing, lighting and planting. Construction is expected to take around 12 months.\n\n The £5.6 million green infrastructure scheme is being funded by the Stormont Department for Infrastructure, the UK Government’s Levelling Up Fund and Ards and North Down Borugh Council. \n\nREAD MORE: Ards North Down Council asking Just Eat to \"resolve\" situation for scammed restaurants\n\nREAD MORE: Ards North Down Council refuses 5G mast after public outcry\n\n The 5.4 kilometre route will help to better connect the town of Newtownards with the city of Bangor by providing a new safe route for those who want to walk, wheel or cycle. \n\nIt is anticipated that it will be popular with leisure users, those wishing to undertake exercise or to access Whitespots Country Park and Ark Farm, as well as those who are commuting to work or places of study such as the Ards South East Regional College.\n\nThe route is being progressed in two stages. The first is Newtownards to the Somme Museum, beginning at Belvedere Road, Newtownards, and largely following the former railway track to the Somme Museum.\n\nThe second stage, the Somme Museum to Green Road Bangor, will pass the Ark Open Farm and then turn off-road in a north-easterly direction following the former railway line and field boundaries to Green Road, Bangor.\n\nMayor of Ards and North Down, Councillor Alistair Cathcart, said: “Having secured planning permission for these sections of greenway last year, it is fantastic that we have now met all the funding requirements, have a contractor appointed and are ‘on the ground’ in terms of construction.\n\n\"We know that greenways contribute positively to local communities by bringing many health and economic benefits and we look forward to delivering these for the residents of Bangor and Newtownards very soon.”\n\nThe Stormont Infrastructure Minister John O’Dowd welcomed the progress made to be able to start work on the scheme. He said: “I am delighted that my Department could contribute £2.8 million to deliver this greenway project between Bangor and Newtownards .\n\n\"By investing in greenways and active travel infrastructure we are giving more realistic options for people to think about how they travel, particularly for shorter everyday journeys. Once completed this greenway will provide a safe alternative route for those who choose to leave the car at home and use it to travel to work or to study, to shop, to visit family and friends or simply just for leisure.\n\n“By making small changes such as choosing to walk, wheel or cycle we can all make a big difference in beating congestion, reducing our carbon footprint and improving our physical and mental wellbeing.”\n\nFor all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.",

        "summary": "The landlord failed to transfer the licence when becoming a private limited company",
        "text": "Belfast Council has turned down a HMO application for a street in the Stranmillis area with more than three times the council limit on multiple occupation homes.\n\n Elected representatives at the November meeting of the Belfast City Council Licensing Committee rejected an application for a new HMO licence by Torrbeg Properties Ltd for 10 Sandymount Street, Belfast, BT9 on the basis of overprovision of HMOs in the area. \n\nThe property has been owned for over 30 years by the same person, but a decision by the owner, a former lawyer, to transfer the property to a private limited company, meant the previous HMO licence ceased to have effect. The owner did not contact the council during the transfer, and the property then required a new HMO licence application.\n\nREAD MORE:Belfast student accommodation blocks get green-light at City Hall\n\nREAD MORE:Belfast city centre hotel planned for old RUC barracks gets council green light for second time\n\nThe council licensing report on the application states: “The property had the benefit of an HMO licence issued by the council on the May 11 2020 to Mr. Hugh Curran and Ms. Bridget Mulholland with an expiry date of May 11 2025.\n\n“In February 2021 the ownership of the property was transferred to Torrbeg Properties Limited and in accordance with section 28 of the 2016 Act the licence ceased to have effect on the date of transfer. The NIHMO Unit was not informed of the change of ownership at that time. An application for a new HMO licence was received from Torrbeg Properties Limited on August 2 2024.”\n\nThe council received a communication from Mr Curran stating: “On or about 1990 I purchased the dwelling 10 Sandymount Street. Since the date of purchasing, the premises have been let in multiple occupation, managed in compliance with all relevant planning and regulatory controls, and in absence of any adverse notices.\n\n“In 2007 I retired from legal practice, and in 2019 in consultation with my accountant I was advised to transfer the premises to a private limited company. In February 2020 Torrbeg Properties Ltd was incorporated, with my wife Anne and I appointed the sole shareholders and directors, and the premises were transferred to the company in 2023.”\n\n Houses of Multiple Occupation, or HMOs, which landlords lease out to three or more tenants from different addresses, have become increasingly controversial, with some arguing they have negatively affected communities and led to anti-social behaviour, in places like the Holyland and Stranmillis in South Belfast where landlords rent houses to undergraduates. \n\n Applications for new HMO licences have increased in other parts of the city in recent months, notably in North Belfast, and have been consistently rejected by councillors in this part of the city. Licences are issued for five year periods. \n\nHMO licence renewal cannot be refused on the basis of overprovision of such properties in an area, but new licences can be refused on this basis.\n\nWhile the council policy is that HMOs should not account for more than 20 percent of any area of housing management, in reality many streets greatly exceed this, with some in the Holyland reaching over 90 percent. Outside housing policy areas the threshold is 10 percent.\n\nAs of October 17 2024, 76 percent of all dwelling units in policy area Sandymount was made up of HMOs and intensive forms of accommodation flats/apartments, which in turn exceeds the 20 percent development limit as set out at policy. There are 109, that is 64 percent licensed HMOs, with a capacity of 469 persons in the area.\n\nOn that date, out of 80 premises available for rent within the BT9 area on the website PropertyNews.com, there were 18 licensed HMOs containing 69 bedspaces. The HMO accommodation was available immediately.\n\nThe council said in its report: “The council recognises that there is a need for intensive forms of housing and to meet this demand, HMOs are an important component of this housing provision.\n\n“HMOs, alongside other accommodation options within the private rented sector, play an important role in meeting the housing needs of people who are single, who have temporary employment, students, low-income households and, more recently, migrant workers.\n\n“In September 2017 the Housing Executive published the document 'Housing Market Analysis Update – Belfast City Council Area' which states 'HMOs form an important element of the PRS, particularly for younger people on low incomes and for single people, under the age of 35, affected by the limitation of housing benefit to the shared room rate. Anecdotal evidence also indicates that this has been a popular sector with migrant workers'.”\n\nIt added: “Ulster University Director of Campus Life told members of the Council’s City Growth and Regeneration Committee that there was an 'increase in competition for HMO’s particularly from NIHE, Immigration Services and statutory agencies and there were increasing accommodation issues across the housing sector which required a holistic view and should include the consideration of international students, families and graduates looking for professional accommodation'.\n\n“However, QUB Director of Student Plus confirmed to members that the current trend indicated a significant move of students to purpose-built student accommodation blocks.”\n\nIt states: “With the continued expansion of the purpose-built student accommodation sector and students transitioning from private rentals to PBMSAs, it is too early to tell whether the increased competition from nonstudents for HMOs is a temporary problem (which can be managed by the contraction in students residing in existing HMO accommodation within the locality) or evidence of an emerging long-term supply issue.”\n\nFor all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.",

        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — For six minutes, Jordan Neely was pinned to a subway floor in a chokehold that ended with him lying still. But that’s not what killed him, a forensic pathologist testified Thursday in defense of the military-trained commuter charged with killing Neely.\n\nA New York City medical examiner determined that Daniel Penny’s chokehold killed Neely, an agitated, mentally ill man whom Penny and some other riders found threatening.\n\nBut the defense’s pathologist, Dr. Satish Chundru, told jurors that Neely’s medical records and bystander video didn’t show telltale signs of known types of fatal chokeholds.\n\nAmong the discrepancies, he said: the location and extent of bruising on Neely’s neck, and the small amount of petechiae — small red spots caused by subsurface bleeding — on his eyelids.\n\n“In your opinion, did Mr. Penny choke Mr. Neely to death?” defense lawyer Steven Raiser asked.\n\n“No,” replied Chundru, who has worked as a medical examiner for county governments in Florida and Texas.\n\nHe said Neely died from “the combined effects” of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion.\n\n“The chokehold did not cause death,” the pathologist said.\n\nPenny, 26, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. His defense says the Marine veteran and architecture student was defending himself and a car full of subway riders.\n\nNeely, 30, sometimes entertained subway riders as a Michael Jackson impersonator. But he also had a history of psychiatric and drug problems and a criminal record that included assaulting a woman at a subway station.\n\nWhen they crossed paths in a subway car on May 1, 2023, Neely was begging for money, shouting about being willing to die or go to jail, and making sudden movements, according to witnesses. Penny has said Neely lurched toward a woman with a small child and said, “I will kill.”\n\nPenny put his arm around Neely’s neck, took him to the floor and held Neely there, with Penny’s legs around him, for close to six minutes, bystander videos show. Neely had stopped moving during roughly the last minute.",

        "text": "(InvestigateWest) — On a recent Monday morning, workers began their week on a large poultry farm in Franklin County, Washington, home to over 800,000 chickens.\n\nBy the end of the day, avian flu had been discovered among some of those chickens. By the end of the week, four workers came down with the illness, which had infected only a handful of other people in the U.S. And after two more days of testing by the Benton Franklin Health District, another 10 workers at the farm tested positive.\n\nThat outbreak, initially detected Oct. 14, represented the first human cases this year of the avian flu in the Pacific Northwest. The first human case in Oregon was confirmed Nov. 15, adding to mounting evidence that the flu is spreading to farmworker populations across the Western U.S. But efforts to test and monitor the disease among workers are spotty and inconsistent and leave the responsibility for getting tested on the laborers themselves, many of whom are undocumented and can’t afford to take time off if they test positive. \n\nMeanwhile, the virus is spreading rapidly among cows and chickens, raising concerns among epidemiologists that the avian flu could merge with the regular flu and cause a pandemic, making it even more urgent to try to limit the spread among people.\n\nRegular testing helps health officials better understand how the virus is being transmitted and how to protect workers. Without it, dozens of positive workers could be undetected, leaving them to handle symptoms on their own. \n\n“The gold standard for public health is to be able to respond, to do surveillance and to understand what’s happening,” said Amy Liebman, chief program officer of workers, environment and climate for Migrant Clinicians Network, a nonprofit organization made up of health care workers who provide care to underserved communities. “If we don’t know that these things are happening, it’s very hard to respond.”\n\nIn Idaho, which has recorded the most cases among livestock of any state in the region, only seven human tests have been conducted, and officials are not gathering information about workers on farms with animal outbreaks. By contrast, Washington has tested 77 people — all of whom were associated with the Franklin County farm — and Oregon has tested 33, and both states are gathering information about exposed workers.\n\nWashington and Oregon are two of six states where humans have tested positive for the avian flu, but infectious disease researchers suspect there are far more unreported cases because of a lack of testing by state and local health districts.\n\n“The ratios of how many herds and flocks have tested positive versus how many people have been tested, that stresses me out in every state,” said Elizabeth Strater, spokesperson for United Farm Workers, who is based in Los Angeles and previously worked on farmworker union efforts in Washington and Oregon. \n\nAvian flu has infected wild birds, chickens and cattle in states across the U.S. Since March, Idaho has reported 35 positive cases of avian flu in cattle and 41 in poultry, Washington has 52 cases among poultry, and Oregon has 41 among poultry. There is no known human-to-human spread so far, which keeps the public health risk low, but if transmission between humans happened, scientists worry it could grow into a dangerous pandemic. \n\nThe CDC recommends that all persons exposed to avian influenza virus from infected birds, cattle or other animals be monitored for symptoms of infection and tested if they had close contact with a positive case, starting the first day they were exposed and continuing until 10 days after the last exposure. In early November, the agency called for increased testing by states to fight the spread of the virus.\n\nNone of the three Northwestern states require testing of people exposed to animals with avian flu. In Idaho, health districts are waiting for a human case before even beginning to gather information about exposed workers. In Oregon, health districts offer testing, but they don’t require it and only offer tests to people who work with a sick animal without personal protective equipment. \n\nMike Lang, spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Health, said the state “will evaluate each opportunity to test people as it comes.” \n\nAmy Dillon, spokesperson for South Central Public Health District which encompasses Cassia County, where Idaho’s first outbreak of avian flu was found in cows, said the health district is focusing on distributing personal protective equipment to dairy farms rather than testing. \n\n“We are not getting line lists relating to potential avian flu exposure, because there have been no human cases in the state of Idaho at this time,” Dillon said.\n\nBut farmworker advocates and public health experts say there is a vast undercount of human avian flu cases and testing more workers who don’t have symptoms would help address the undercount and help detect positive cases to prevent the continued spread. \n\n‘Reservations about getting tested’\n\nPast protocols in cases of a transmissible illness outbreak include contact tracing, which is when a health district gathers a list of people who were exposed and their contact information, age, location and symptoms so that they can screen them for the illness. \n\nBut public health districts in Idaho are not doing such contact tracing yet.\n\nIn an email, AJ McWhorter, public information officer for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, said just three people were tested by a local public health district in June. The other four tests were completed by private clinics or hospitals. Only one person was tested in the last two months, despite the U.S. Department of Agriculture report of two new cases among cattle in commercial dairies in the last 30 days. \n\nIn Idaho, it is up to the individual employers to encourage workers to be tested. Rick Naerebout, executive director of the Idaho Dairymen’s Association, said the association and health districts have ensured that dairies with positive avian flu cases in their cattle have information about the flu and where to test, but it is up to them to go get tested. \n\n“You’ve got a workforce (in dairies) that doesn't always have legal status, so there’s going to be reservations about going and getting tested at a health district, or any sort of medical service,” Naerebout said. \n\nLiebman, who works with undocumented farmworkers in her role at the Migrant Clinician Network, said there are always risks for undocumented migrants in the U.S., but they do not need to provide their immigration status to obtain a flu shot or health care of any kind. \n\nDillon said if there was a human case in Idaho, the health district may decide to do contact tracing for exposed people, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIdaho’s dairy industry employs over 33,000 workers and is ranked third in the U.S. for milk production. Around 90% of Idaho dairy workers are migrant workers, and many of them are undocumented. \n\nIn the Franklin County, Washington, outbreak, Heather Hill, a public health nurse and deputy director of the Benton Franklin Health District, said district staff spoke with the poultry farm owners, who reported workers with pink eye, which is a symptom of the avian flu virus. The district then tested workers at two clinics it hosted at the farm. \n\nAfter the clinics, Hill said the district got a list and contact information for all the potential employees who were exposed. The district also offered standard flu vaccines.\n\nTen new cases among animals were reported in Snohomish County in early November, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But no new workers were tested by the Washington Department of Health.\n\nLiebman said surveillance is one of the few ways public health agencies can understand how people are getting exposed to the illness. Surveillance refers to having public health staff regularly contact local private health care providers and workers to get information about whether they’re seeing symptoms of the flu. \n\n“You want to try to understand and do a case report on exposure,” Liebman said. “You try to ask someone who is testing positive questions like ‘Who were you in contact with? What were you in contact with? Did the farm already have a positive test or positive herd? Were you working with sick animals? Were you not around animals at all, and what were your tasks that you were doing? Are you a milker? Are you a pusher? Are you dealing with calves?’ When you understand the tasks and what kind of PPE they were wearing, you begin to understand the exposure.”\n\nStrater told InvestigateWest that she hasn’t heard of any states doing surveillance. Instead, she said, they are doing more passive monitoring, by relying on employers to report workers who show symptoms of avian flu. \n\n“Some employers will, some won’t,” she said. \n\nClinicians cite Colorado as a state that has effectively responded to outbreaks of avian flu by testing workers. The state has tested 137 people who were exposed, according to the Colorado of Public Health and Environment. Public health workers in Colorado and Michigan also tested blood samples of over 100 workers who were known to have been working with infected cows and found 7% had avian flu antibodies, meaning they had unknowingly contracted the virus.\n\nBut Liebman said that even workers who were exposed to positive animals but not showing symptoms should be tested. \n\nBy testing all exposed workers, Liebman said, local health authorities would have “a much better understanding of transmission, of what protects the worker and the likelihood of workers actually even having it while being asymptomatic.” \n\nWhen asked why they weren’t testing more workers, Dillion said that workers in Idaho were given equipment to protect themselves while working and feels that is sufficient enough not to warrant testing people without symptoms. \n\nJonathan Modie, spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said they reserve testing for people with symptoms or asymptomatic people who had a high-risk exposure, meaning a breach or misuse of PPE. Lang said the Washington Department of Health is clarifying the new CDC guidelines before it implements more testing. \n\nA high mortality rate\n\nSo far, human cases of avian flu have been mild. Dr. Jürgen Richt, a professor and director of the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases at Kansas State University, told InvestigateWest that so far people who have tested positive for avian flu have had mild respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis, or pink eye.\n\nBut that wasn’t always the case. In 2003, when avian flu reemerged after the first outbreak in 1996, Richt said there was transmission of the flu to humans and there was a high fatality rate. \n\nAccording to Yale Medicine, the mortality rate was 50% for the 900 people who were infected with the bird flu from 2003 to present. \n\n“We were lucky that the virus got milder over time in humans,” Richt said. \n\nEven with mild symptoms, Liebman said people who are positive for avian flu are recommended Tamiflu to treat the illness and to try to minimize the spread. \n\nAvian flu has destroyed many backyard poultry operations in the Pacific Northwest and cost commercial farmers dairy milk and their flocks and eggs. \n\nAmber Betts, spokesperson for the Washington Department of Agriculture, said in poultry, early signs of an avian flu outbreak include chickens becoming lethargic and confused. In dairy operations, an early sign is a significant drop in milk production. \n\nOnce a veterinarian and lab receive positive tests results for avian flu, the farm has to stop operations and sanitize. For backyard farms, Betts said there is a fallow period, where no animals can live on the backyard farm for at least 120 days. But that period is shorter for commercial farms because there are heavy disinfection and testing procedures that a farmer must do before they can begin farming again. \n\nIf a farm does have a positive case of the flu, a farmer must report it, Betts said. The Department of Agriculture gives farmers indemnity payments for eggs and chickens that they had to euthanize for being exposed to the flu. \n\nThere are no payments to a farm owner if any of their workers contract avian flu and must take time away from work. That is what worries Strater, who says it is a gamble to rely on the farm owner and workers to test themselves or report positive cases. \n\n“The issue is the employers because both the employers and the workers have a financial incentive to avoid testing,” she said.\n\nAll recorded cases of avian flu in humans, except for one, came from farmworkers who worked with infected animals. \n\n“Really what we’ve seen in humans is when the humans are working with an infected animal,” Betts said. “That could be while they are helping clean up after an outbreak in a farm and maybe biosecurity protocols aren’t to the highest standards. Maybe somebody accidentally rubs their eye or that kind of thing.”\n\nHumans can get the virus from animals by touching an infected animal’s bodily fluids, including animal milk, and from touching a surface that was contaminated with the virus and then touching their eyes or mouth. People who have worked with infected animals are considered a “high risk exposure,” according to the CDC, and it recommends they be tested for the virus by local health districts. \n\nSome scientists worry about the avian flu mixing with the seasonal flu in pigs, where an avian flu case was found in one in Oregon. Pigs are susceptible to both animal and human viruses. Scientists say a mixing of the two viruses could increase the risk of a flu pandemic. \n\n‘Worker health and safety is public health’\n\nLiebman thinks the public health response to avian flu should be informed by what people learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, which ravaged agricultural and meat packing plants where workers were not being tested for the highly transmissible virus. \n\nAdvocates for workers then, and now, say workers can’t afford to have a positive test. They don’t get paid sick time off work if they have to quarantine for two weeks.\n\nUnlike many of the severe symptoms of COVID-19, people who are positive for avian flu have experienced mild symptoms that they could hide if they want to continue working. \n\nThe hesitancy is why Liebman says it is important for health departments to deploy community health workers who speak Spanish, who come from similar backgrounds as the workers and who can understand their hesitancy to report an exposure or illness. \n\n“You have to understand that the risk that a worker takes simply to be in this country to work is really significant, and their priority is to stay employed and work,” she said. “There’s a lot of fear around potentially losing their job. They don’t want to make their employer upset. They don’t want to miss any work. There’s fear of just losing money if they do test positive.” \n\nInvestigateWest is an independent news nonprofit dedicated to investigative journalism in the Pacific Northwest.

        "text": "Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire MP Angus MacDonald has had the most successful year of his life. He began 2024 as a multi-millionaire and as a Highland councillor, and midway through it upset the political odds by winning in the general election and ousting Drew Hendry from a position which not so long ago looked to be one Mr Hendry might occupy for years ahead.\n\nOur new MP has had a busy first few months and is steadily establishing his credentials with his constituents.\n\n• More from Colin Campbell\n\n• More from our columnists\n\n• Sign up for our free newsletters\n\nHow well he's adjusted to this whirlwind of activity only he and his family will know. But having made a considerable success of his time on this earth up to now, I doubt if he's had much time or inclination to ponder the circumstances in which he will finally leave it.\n\nHowever, his role as an MP places on him a range of diverse responsibilities. Next week at Westminster MPs will vote on a bill to introduce \"assisted dying\" legislation, which would give terminally ill people the right to end their lives. And while with any luck he is a long way from shuffling off his own mortal coil, that is a responsibility Mr MacDonald obviously takes very seriously.\n\nHe has publicly stated he will vote against assisted dying. His reasons for doing so he has already outlined in the Courier.\n\nThis is a contentious issue but debate around it has generally been low-key and dignified. I disagree with Mr MacDonald but he has his view and I respect it. People have different opinions and in the end, under our parliamentary system, one stance will prevail.\n\nI'm at an age when this becomes of considerably more relevance than when I was a teenager. It's not something to dwell on too much but it does crop up in conversation with those of similar vintage.\n\nAnd whenever it does, my thoughts always go back to the departure of my father 46 years ago. He suffered the late stage ravages of cancer at home bravely and without complaint, but it was distressing to see a lifelong son of the soil accustomed to being out working every hour of daylight and beyond confined to his bed at home and visibly shrinking with frustration and weakness.\n\nOur local doctor, a man who knew all his patients by name and seemed to be always available for house calls, came to our house on a Saturday night for what was to be the last of many visits. Before his arrival my father was in pain and suffering and it was clearly only a matter of time. After the doctor had left, he was as talkative and full of bright eyed good cheer as he'd ever been in his life. I didn't fully realise it at the time but the doctor had, after talking to my mother and other older relatives, administered a well-judged cocktail of drugs which would bring about only one outcome.\n\nAnd it was totally and utterly the right thing to do. My father chatted away with us in high spirits for a couple of hours until weariness overtook him, he drifted quietly off to sleep, and a few hours later he was gone.\n\nIt was the best possible way to go in the circumstances. But as things stand, would modern-day doctors be able and willing to administer such drugs? Is it even legal?\n\nI ardently hope the assisted dying bill is passed and clarification is delivered on the ways which unnecessary suffering can be avoided at or near the end of life.\n\nDeath will always be a distinctly unpleasant prospect. But a clear change in the law to allow assisted dying will mean that many of us perhaps need not fear the circumstances surrounding it quite so much. It's the last choice we'll ever make. And we should not be denied the right to make it.\n\nDo you want to respond to this article? If so, click here to submit your thoughts and they may be published in print.",

        "text": "Television has existed for nearly a century, and it's since become an instrumental part of American life. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' American Time Use Survey, nearly 3 in 4 (74%) Americans watch television daily as of 2023, with the average American spending two hours and 40 minutes of their day in front of the \"idiot box.\"\n\nMany Americans watch TV to keep up with the news, while others root for their favorite sports teams. For almost as long as there's been broadcast television, however, there has been programming—from scripted dramas to comedies and documentary series—to entertain and inform viewers. These programs are recognized chiefly by the Emmy Awards, which the Television Academy has given out yearly since 1949. Though Regional and Daytime Emmys are awarded to shows that meet those respective requirements, the most cultural discussion takes place around the Primetime and Creative Arts Emmys, which highlight outstanding achievements in the most-watched television programs.\n\nThe Primetime Emmys recognize overall series quality, lead and supporting acting, directing, and writing, among other categories. The Creative Arts Emmy awards achievements in more technical fields, such as costumes, makeup, and special effects, as well as alternative programming like docuseries and variety specials. An Emmy win is a lifelong goal for many Hollywood stars and creators, forming the \"E\" in \"EGOT\" (winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony).\n\nTo celebrate the most Emmy-awarded television shows of all time, Stacker rounded up the top 25 using the Emmys database and other sources. All drama, comedy, competition, variety, reality, and limited series were considered. Shows were ranked by their number of Emmy wins, with ties broken by the number of nominations. The list includes nominations for the 2024 Emmys, but those winners won't be announced until the Sept. 15 ceremony.\n\nLooking at the following list, it's clear to see several distinct eras emerging, from the long-running sitcoms of the '80s and '90s to the new golden age of television ushered in by \"The Sopranos\" and other premium programming. As streaming services like Apple TV+, Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video join HBO in spending exorbitant sums on new content, it remains to be seen where television will go in the coming years. But many of us—about three-quarters, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data—will surely be sticking around to watch!\n\nYou may also like: Best true crime series of all time",

Rashford will want to make a good first impression on his new boss, who's under just as much pressure to reap results from his frontman. \n\nSpeaking to SportsKeeda, Paul Merson warned co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that United could have a 'big problem' on their hands if Amorim can't help Rashford return to his former self. The Arsenal legend said: \"Marcus Rashford was clearly not the first-choice in attack under Ruud van Nistelrooy. \n\n\"So he has to turn things around under Amorim. If he is unable to do that, I think United have a big problem. Rashford's wages are going to become an issue if they want to move him on. \n\n\"I don't know who buys him at the moment. It will be interesting to see how he performs under Amorim, certainly something to keep an eye on.\"\n\nAccording to Capology, Rashford currently earns £15.6m a year at United, making him the joint-second highest paid player alongside Bruno Fernandes behind Casemiro. So, with three and a half seasons remaining – and approximately £54.6m left to be paid out – on his deal, higher-ups will be hoping Amorim can help the club get a much greater value for their money.",

        "summary": "Highly anticipated movie Wicked is set to be released this week as Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo take on the lead roles in the Hollywood adaptation of the Broadway play",
        "text": "Wicked could have looked very different as its stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo weren't always the top choice.\n\nThe highly anticipated movie is set to be released on Friday as pop star Ariana plays Glinda and Cynthia takes on Elphaba. Wicked is a Hollywood version of the popular stage musical of the same name, which in turn is an adaptation of the novel published in 1995, written by Gregory Maguire.\n\n It is a reimagining of characters and setting of the classic Wizard of Oz but told from the perspective of two witches before Dorothy's arrival in the mystical land. The movie could have been very different as it was set to be directed by Stephen Daldry before Jon M. Chu took on the job, according to reports.\n\n Daldry reportedly had a very different cast in mind for the film. He would have featured Lady Gaga as Elphaba and Shawn Mendes as Fiyero, reports Page Six. It has been claimed the director met with Lady Gaga multiple times to talk about the role and that she was \"essentially cast in his version\" before it fell through.\n\nThe singer instead turned her focus on Todd Philipps’ Joker sequel Joker: Folie à Deux. Actress Cynthia, who landed the role of Elphaba, recently revealed the extent of work that went into her transformation for the role. She admitted it could take up to four hours to cover her in paint as she confirmed that no CGI was used in the making of the highly-anticipated movie.\n\n\"When you put the costume on, when you put the shoes on and we're supported by all these artists, it just takes it to the next level,\" she revealed on a new NBC programme titled Defying Gravity: The Curtain Rises on Wicked. \"Something happens when all of that green in on. The freckles go on, the hair goes on, the make-up goes on, the eyes go on and it's not me I'm looking at, it's her.\"\n\nCynthia first gained recognition for starring in the Broadway revival of The Color Purple from 2015 to 2017 for which she won numerous accolades including the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. After her incredible career on stage, she turned her attention to films and starred in movies including Widows, Bad Times at the El Royale and as The Blue Fairy in Pinocchio.\n\nWicked is studded with other stars including Oscar laureate Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible, Bridgerton heartthrob Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero Tigelaar, and Jeff Goldblum taking on the mantle of the Wizard of Oz. The long awaited film previously experienced production delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the SAG-AFTRA strike. Wicked was first green lit by Universal Studios in 2012, so it's been a long road to release for filmmakers.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads.",

        "summary": "The actor said that the two first met just prior to filming the '90s romantic comedy, which was directed by the late Garry Marshall",
        "text": "Richard Gere is reminiscing on his long friendship with Julia Roberts, which started with a meeting in his office before he agreed to film Pretty Woman.\n\n During a Nov. 20 appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, the 75-year-old actor said that the two first met prior to filming the '90s romantic comedy, which was directed by the late Garry Marshall. \n\n \"She had made, I think, one film before [Pretty Woman] — Mystic Pizza, and Gary Marshall ... He put us together,\" Gere recounted.\n\n He continued: \"I remember Julia came to see me in New York and he said, 'Richard, Julia, she's good. She's good, you'll like her.' So she came to New York, came to my office, Gary introduced us, and he left. And he called back like 45 minutes later and he said, 'How's it going?' \"\n\n \"And I said, 'It's Gary.' So I'm talking to Gary, and she's on the other side of the desk and she's writing something on one of my Post-its. Then she turns around and puts it down, and I read it and it says, 'Please say yes.' So I said, 'Gary, I think I just said yes.' \"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n Gere said Roberts reminded him of that story during the film's 25th anniversary celebrations.\n\n \"We had such a good time making that,\" Gere said. \"It was really kind of a magic moment for all of us.\"\n\n In a 2015 interview with TODAY around the 25th anniversary of Pretty Woman, Gere said he was \"mesmerized\" by Roberts during their initial meeting.\n\n Marshall, meanwhile, recalled seeing the sparks fly after the actors warmed up to one another.\n\n \"I came out and I saw the two of them at the end of a hall just looking at each other, and right there, I said, look at that chemistry. They don't know each other, and they're doing great,\" the director shared at the time.\n\n Pretty Woman served as a breakthrough role for Roberts, scoring her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.\n\n She and Gere would go on to star as romantic interests in another Marshall film, Runaway Bride, and have stayed in touch over the years. \n\n Gere and his family recently moved to Spain, his wife Alejandra Silva's home country.\n\n As he told Vanity Fair Spain in April, \"For Alejandra, it will be wonderful to be closer to her family, her lifelong friends and her culture. She was very generous in giving me six years living in my world, so it is only fair that I give her at least another six living in hers.\"",

        "summary": "India's space agency, ISRO, has acknowledged that its current satellites aren't ideal for tracking stubble burning due to low resolution. While foreign satellites might offer better data, ISRO says analyzing that information requires significant effort and validation. The agency is working on enhancing its algorithms and incorporating data from Korean and European satellites to improve accuracy.",
        "text": "Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is learnt to have stated that the farm fire-related aspects of the current geostationary platforms are sub-optimal for operational use for tracking stubble fires in Punjab and Haryana region, owing to their overall larger pixel sizes. The latter are learnt to lead to less certain or less actionable information. It has added that development of algorithms for analysing and validating satellite data from foreign satellites for stubble fires will require considerable efforts but the organisation will work on it.As asked by the SCIsro examined satellite data availability for late afternoon/evening period for more accurate assessments of fire counts. The Supreme Court had last week questioned how reports from Korean geostationary satellites seemed to indicate higher stubble fire counts than being reported through Indian satellites and had asked the Centre to get actionable farm fire data from geostationary satellites as well. ET has gathered that in its latest submissions to the SC, the Centre said that according to Isro, data processing and fire detection algorithms for foreign geo-stationary satellite data are developed by respective agencies and are largely not validated over India. It is also learnt to have pointed out that current fire-related products downloaded from geostationary satellites of various foreign agencies also indicate fewer fire counts, in keeping with Indian data. India's INSAT-3DR has a Spatial Resolution of 4 km with images generated every half hour but due to the coarser resolution, number of fire pixels identified is far less than those identified by Lower Earth Orbit satellites such as Aqua MODIS. The satellite found very less fire counts in Punjab and Haryana this year and is working to upgrade algorithms for the latest satellite INSAT-3DS within 6 weeks, Isro has said. Specific algorithms are also being developed to evaluate satellite data from EU's Meteosat-9-SEVIRI (EUMETSAT). Data from the Korean Geo-Kompsat 2 (GK2)-AMI (Advanced Meteorological Imager) requires development of specific algorithms and its validation over Indian region and Isro is working on bringing in Korean products for the same.",

        "text": "Temperatures are set to plunge below freezing in London overnight as a cold snap continues, according to the latest forecast. \n\nA map produced by the Met Office shows the mercury falling to as low as -1C in some areas of the capital.\n\nIn Hounslow and Bromley, temperatures will drop to freezing by 10pm on Thursday. \n\nThe Met’s overall London weather forecast has a low of -1 overnight but the temperature is expected to “feel” even lower.\n\nAccording to the agency, the temperature in Woolwich, south east London will “feel” as low as -4C through the night. This figure is produced by taking other factors into account other than temperature, such as wind speed and humidity. \n\nMeanwhile, the Met Office warned that Storm Bert would bring “heavy rain, strong winds and disruptive snow to parts of the UK through the weekend” and warned of travel disruption and potential flooding.\n\nAn amber alert for heavy snow and ice will be in force between 7am and 5pm on Saturday in an area north of Scotland’s central belt, where 10-20cm is likely on ground above 200 metres and potentially as much as 20-40cm on hills above 400 metres.\n\nA yellow warning of snow and ice for much of Scotland, northern England and parts of western and eastern England and Wales is in force until 10am on Friday.\n\nThere is no snow forecast to fall in London over the coming days, according to the Met Office. \n\nMet Office deputy chief meteorologist Dan Holley said: “Storm Bert marks a shift to much milder air and wintry hazards will gradually diminish through the weekend, but heavy snowfall is expected across parts of northern England and Scotland for a time on Saturday, especially over higher ground, and warnings are in place.\n\n“Heavy rain through Saturday and Sunday, especially in southern and western parts of the UK, will also bring impacts for some with a number of warnings in place.\n\n“We expect 50-75mm of rainfall quite widely within the warning areas, but in excess of 100mm is possible over high ground in parts of Wales and south-west England.\n\n“In addition, rapid melting of lying snow over the weekend and periods of strong winds are likely to exacerbate impacts and bring the potential for travel disruption, as well as flooding for some.”",

        "text": "Ukraine’s F-16 fighters to be connected to NATO’s Link-16 tactical data exchange network\n\nAccording to the Turkish publications, NATO’s specialized committees consider a request from the Defense Ministry of Ukraine to interface onboard electronic equipment of the transferred F-16AM/BM fighters with the Link-16 military tactical data exchange network used by the NATO aviation.\n\nIf the decision is positive, NATO aircraft equipped with such a system (RC-135W, E-3A, P-8A, Saab-340 and others) will provide Ukrainian F-16s with direct access to information from their detection systems. This will increase the situational awareness of Ukrainian pilots. The ability to increase the stealthiness of its attacks on Russian territory at extremely low altitudes is of particular interest to the Ukrainian Air Force. The Link-16 data exchange network will make it possible for Ukraine to obtain data from reconnaissance aircraft with its own ELINT and radar systems turned off.\n\nIf Russia obtains the wreckage and entire F-16 fighters (in case of hijacking) with the Link-16 system, it may have an extremely negative impact on the combat capability of NATO aviation. The Turkish aviation may also be affected as the system may subsequently be transferred to Iran. Noteworthy, Iran already has individual elements of this system.\n\nConnecting Ukrainian F-16s to Link-16 data exchange system will require the installation of additional equipment, which was dismantled during the transfer of the fighters to Ukraine. If this equipment falls into the hands of Russian specialists, they will be able to access NATO codes and ciphers used in the system. To crown it all, Ukrainian servicemen could be bribed to transfer this sensitive data to Russia without physically hijacking the aircraft.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, NATO will face a catastrophe of the scale that the Soviet aviation experienced after the hijacking of the MiG-25P fighter to Japan.\n\nOn September 6, 1976, Senior Lieutenant Viktor Belenko took off in a state-of-the-art MIG-25 and did not return to the base.\n\nThe MIG-25 was a pride of Soviet engineers. The high-altitude interceptor fighter was praised in the West, but Western specialists had no clue about its unique capabilities. The Soviet Union knew how to keep its secrets. Belenko landed at the Hakodate airport on Hokkaido and asked for political asylum in the United States. The aircraft was returned to the Soviet Union after Western engineers studied its technical data. Belenko received American citizenship, worked as an aerospace engineer and consulted for the US Air Force. He died in the USA in 2023.\n\nThe General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is an American single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft originally developed by General Dynamics for the United States Air Force (USAF). Designed as an air superiority day fighter, it evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft with over 4,600 built since 1976. Although no longer purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions are being built for export. In 1993, General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation, which became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta. The F-16’s key features include a frameless bubble canopy for enhanced cockpit visibility, a side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering, an ejection seat reclined 30 degrees from vertical to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot, and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system that helps to make it an agile aircraft. The fighter has a single turbofan engine, an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 hardpoints. Although officially named “Fighting Falcon”, the aircraft is commonly known by the nickname “Viper”.",

        "text": "به گزارش خبرنگار مهر، مسعود پزشکیان شامگاه امروز و در برنامه پایانی سفر یک روزه به سیستان و بلوچستان، در گفت‌وگوی زنده خبری که از شبکه استانی هامون پخش شد، افزود: در این سفر یک روزه به سیستان و بلوچستان با محوریت زاهدان، جلسات و نشستهای متعددی برگزار شد، مشکلات و مسائل مختلف استان را بررسی کردیم اما به علت پاره‌ای از مسائل امنیتی بیشتر از این نتوانستیم بمانیم، اما دو سفر دیگر به زابل و چابهار خواهیم داشت و از نزدیک با مردم گفت‌وگو خواهیم کرد.\n\nوی اظهار کرد: آن چیزی که امروز در این سفر به عنوان رئیس جمهور و وزرا در حوزه‌های مختلف متعهد شدند، با سازمان برنامه و بودجه اعتبارات آن هماهنگ و پیش بینی شده و در این راستا، حدود ۱۲۴ همت برای ۳۳ مصوبه در نظر گرفته شده است.\n\nوی بیان کرد: ۳۴ هزار میلیارد تومان از بودجه‌های عمومی دولت و ۲۰ هزار میلیارد تومان از بانک‌ها و ۷۰ هزار میلیارد تومان از شرکت‌ها و هلدینگ‌های بزرگ برای سیستان و بلوچستان اختصاص می‌یابد تا شاهد توسعه و آبادانی این استان باشیم.\n\nوی با بیان اینکه مطلب که اقتصاد دریا محور اولویت دولت چهاردهم است، تصریح کرد: دید و نگاه دولت چهاردهم، این هست که کوریدور شمال به جنوب به سرعت انجام شود، موضوع مکران که مورد تاکید رهبر مقام معظم انقلاب است، توسعه یابد و اقداماتی صورت گیرد.\n\nپزشکیان اضافه کرد: به دنبال هم‌زبانی و هم‌گرایی هستیم، برخی از کارها نیاز به کار کارشناسی دارد تا پروژه‌ها طراحی شوند.\n\nوی گفت: علت اینکه سیستان و بلوچستان اولین مقصد سفرهای استانی بود، علاقه خاصی هست که از مدت‌ها قبل از پیروزی انقلاب اسلامی به سیستان و بلوچستان دارم در منطقه زابل خدمت کرده ام و تجربه‌های زیادی از این استان در ذهن داشته و مشکلات و گرفتاری‌های مردم را می‌دانستیم، با نگاهی که در این استان باید محرومیت زایی کنیم و عدالت اجرا شود، به این استان سفر کردیم.\n\nوی افزود: سیستان و بلوچستان در بسیاری از شاخص‌ها از آخر اول است تلاش می‌کنیم این وضعیت را بهبود دهیم،\n\nباید تغییر در مدیریت سیستم به وجود بیاید و نگاه‌ها اصلاح شود.\n\nرئیس جمهور در ادامه بیان کرد: اگر به این‌ها باور داشته باشیم، تغییر ایجاد می‌شود، این باور در مدیران باید شکل گیرد و مردم به ما کمک کنند، با کمک مردم همان‌طور که رهبر معظم انقلاب شعار سال را مشارکت مردم و رونق اقتصادی تعریف کردند هیچ قدرتی ما را زمین گیر نخواهد کرد.\n\nوی تاکید کرد: خدمتگزار مردم هستیم و تلاش خواهیم کرد تا جایی که می‌توانیم و بر اساس توانی که داریم، در خدمت مردم باشیم و مردم هم در خدمت جامعه خود و آینده فرزندانشان و استان باشند.\n\nپزشکیان گفت: حفظ شأن حرمت مردم، یکی از اولویت‌هایی هست که در سفرهای استانی در اولویت قرار دارد، تلاش خواهیم کرد مشکلات مردم را حل کنیم، این وجه تمایز سفرهای استانی دولت چهاردهم است.\n\nوی اضافه کرد: در چشم اندازی که رهبر معظم انقلاب، مشخص کردند، قرار هست ایران کشوری پیشرفته و در اقتصاد، علم و فناوری، اول در منطقه باشد، باید به دنبال تکنولوژیی باشیم که کمتر از همسایگان ما نباشد، این چشم انداز برای ما مشخص شده و خواهان آن هستیم که ایران اولین باشد، این نگاه دولت چهاردهم است.\n\nوی تصریح کرد: اگر بتوانیم ایرانی بسازیم که حسرت دیگران را به دنبال داشته باشد و الهام بخش باشد این آرزوی هر ایرانی بوده و هست، برای سیستان و بلوچستان نیز این چشم انداز وجود دارد و دنبال آن هستیم.\n\nوی افزود: نیاز هست بهترین شویم و برای بهتر شدن باید زحمت و تلاش کنیم و با همدلی و همراهی و با نگاه به آن چشم انداز و توجه به بیانات رهبر معظم انقلاب راه را پیش برد.\n\nوی گفت: موظف هستیم بستر را آماده کنیم تا بخش خصوصی نیز کار خود را انجام دهد، باید موانع بخش خصوصی را رفع کرد و بخش خصوصی با پیشرفته‌ترین راهکار پای کار باشد.\n\nباید نقشه راهی را با داشته‌ها و اطلاعات کافی و نیروی انسانی طراحی کرد که بتوانیم برای آینده این مشکلات را نه تنها نداشته باشیم، بلکه آینده‌ای روشن توام با عزت و سربلندی برای مردم داشته باشیم و این امکان‌پذیر نیست مگر اینکه مردم همراهی کنند.",

        "title": "Britain’s mini-budget crisis: Is it impacting the US Bond Market?",
        "summary": "Financial strategists are increasingly concerned that the United States could encounter a crisis similar to Britain's notorious \"mini-budget\" debacle of 2022.",
        "text": "Concerns are growing among financial strategists that the United States may face a crisis reminiscent of Britain’s infamous mini-budget fiasco in 2022. Bond experts warn that a return of Donald Trump to the White House could spark economic volatility, raising bond yields and destabilizing the U.S. dollar.The Mini-Budget Crisis in BritainBritain’s mini-budget debacle under then-Prime Minister Liz Truss and Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng was a defining moment of financial chaos. In September 2022, the duo introduced sweeping tax cuts in an unscheduled fiscal announcement, aiming to stimulate growth. However, the markets reacted violently.The British pound plummeted to a historic low against the U.S. dollar, while government bond prices collapsed, prompting an emergency intervention by the Bank of England. The fallout forced Truss and Kwarteng to resign after just weeks in office, and their policies were largely reversed.This episode demonstrated the dangers of fiscal overreach, particularly when markets perceive a lack of credibility or discipline.Could the US Face a Similar Scenario?Several bond strategists believe the U.S. could experience a parallel crisis, especially if Trump’s proposed economic policies—tax cuts, deregulation, and increased borrowing—materialize. These measures, while intended to spur growth, could inflate the federal deficit and unnerve bond markets.Althea Spinozzi, head of fixed income strategy at Saxo Bank, warns that such policies may lead to heightened inflation expectations and a surge in U.S. Treasury yields. “A Trump presidency brings the specter of currency volatility and higher borrowing costs, echoing Britain’s mini-budget turmoil,” she said.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, a key indicator of market sentiment, could breach the 5% mark as investors demand higher returns to offset risks.The U.S. Dollar’s Role in Mitigating RiskUnlike Britain, the U.S. benefits from the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency and the unparalleled liquidity of its Treasury market. These factors provide a buffer against sudden financial shocks.Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, acknowledges this advantage but cautions against complacency. “While the dollar’s dominance reduces the likelihood of a crisis, rising yields indicate growing unease among investors about absorbing an increased supply of bonds,” he said, as mentioned in a report by CNBC.Lessons from the U.K. ExperienceThe British crisis underscores the importance of balancing fiscal stimulus with market confidence. Kwarteng’s tax cuts lacked funding details, fueling panic among investors. In the U.S., concerns about unsustainable debt levels could trigger a similar loss of confidence if fiscal policies are perceived as reckless.Thierry Wizman, global strategist at Macquarie Group, adds that global fiscal irresponsibility could limit the impact. “When all major economies face high deficits, the relative risk is diluted,” he explained, though he acknowledged that any divergence in fiscal discipline could spark a crisis.What Lies Ahead for the U.S.?While a full-scale mini-budget-style crisis may be unlikely for the U.S., the risks of inflation, rising yields, and fiscal uncertainty remain significant.Bond strategists agree that prudent economic policies and clear communication will be crucial to maintaining market stability in the face of evolving challenges.FAQs:What Is the Bond Market? The bond market, also known as the debt market, fixed-income market, or credit market, encompasses all trades and issuances of debt securities.

        "title": "Who stole 24,240 bottles of Guy Fieri’s tequila?",
        "summary": "Two trucks of tequila from the company that Fieri founded with Sammy Hagar were stolen after being diverted from their planned route, authorities said.\n\n\nThe post Who stole 24,240 bottles of Guy Fieri’s tequila? appeared first on Boston.com.",
        "text": "A screenwriter could try pitching this one to a Hollywood executive: a heist movie starring a flamboyant television host and a veteran rock ’n’ roll frontman on the hunt for $1 million worth of stolen tequila.\n\nThe crime happened this month after two trucks carrying tequila made by Santo Spirits, a brand founded by Guy Fieri, the celebrity restaurateur and spiky-haired host of “Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives,” and Sammy Hagar, the former lead singer for Van Halen, crossed from Mexico into Laredo, Texas.\n\nJoe Baeza, an investigator with the Laredo Police Department, said that after the trucks arrived at a warehouse in the city, they were picked up by legitimate truck drivers who set out to take them to their intended destination, a warehouse in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut somewhere along the route, he said, the drivers received new orders from someone they assumed was in charge of the delivery, directing them to go to a warehouse in Los Angeles because of problems at the warehouse in Pennsylvania. The drivers brought the tequila to what appeared to be a legitimate warehouse in Los Angeles, where they left it.\n\n“That was the last time anybody knew or saw where the tequila was,” Baeza said, adding that the theft was reported to the Laredo Police Department Nov. 12.\n\n“All indications are this is a theft,” he said. “I don’t think this is a case of a misplaced load of tequila. I’m pretty sure it’s probably gone.”\n\nDan Butkus, CEO of Santo Spirits, said that the company was robbed of 24,240 bottles of tequila, including 240 bottles of Extra Añejo Single Barrel, which had been aged for more than 36 months and typically sells for $119 per bottle.\n\nIt was the first batch of that aged tequila that the company, founded in 2017, had produced, he said. The total retail value of the purloined tequila was $1 million, according to Santo Spirits.\n\nFieri, who could not be immediately reached for comment, told People magazine that he was astounded that the theft involved two trucks of his tequila.\n\n“I mean, one is one,” he said. “But now you’ve got to have double the amount of people to pull off the double heist. It just seems so much riskier to take two trucks.”\n\nIn an emailed statement, Hagar called the theft “a gigantic setback for any independently owned company in a hugely competitive market.”\n\n“But Guy and I are not the type to sit back and whine over spilled tequila,” he said. “Our distillery is working day and night right now to replace as much stock as we can.”\n\nIncidents of cargo theft are projected to increase by more than 25% this year compared with 2023, a record year, according to CargoNet, a subsidiary of Verisk, a business focused on theft prevention and recovery for the insurance industry.\n\nWhile there are fewer instances of alcoholic beverage shipments being stolen this year compared with 2023, when much of the cargo theft involved hard seltzers, the theft in 2024 has been “almost exclusively hard liquor,” CargoNet said in a statement.\n\nButkus said that he had managed to piece together some troubling information about his company’s pilfered tequila. He said that a trucking broker had given the job to a trucking company that then transferred the job to another company — a practice called “double brokering.”\n\nButkus said that the trucking broker had received fictitious accounts of breakdowns and other reasons that the drivers could not bring the tequila to the warehouse in Pennsylvania. He said one of the trucks had used a GPS emulator to disguise its location.\n\nButkus said that he suspected that much of the tequila would be sold on the black market, to bars and restaurants or people on the street.\n\n“It’s a big momentum killer and it’s definitely a gut punch,” he said. “It’s not going to break us, and we all feel we’re going to come out stronger from it. But it’s really frustrating.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

        "text": "In the last four to five years, the term ‘data centre’ has come to the forefront primarily because of the high demand for this infrastructure setup, especially after COVID-19, when the adoption of cloud increased, Sharad Agarwal, CEO, Sify Infinit Spaces Ltd., said at The Hindu AI Summit 2024 on Thursday. \n\nHuge investments are being committed on data centres, he said during a fireside chat on “Data Centres in the age if AI: Enabling Scalability, Security and Sustainability” with Kunal Shankar, Deputy Business Editor, The Hindu. Mr. Agarwal highlighted how new generation data centres were launched by Sify in Chennai, Bengaluru and Mumbai. \n\nResponding to a query on water consumption in the industry, he said: “One thing that the data centre industry is doing, and we are also doing at Sify, is that net footprint on the environment has to be minimal, and we have to do it in a sustainable manner. That means water is not a mandatory ingredient for the data centres, especially the clean water is not something that is must for the expansion of a data centre.” \n\nMr. Agarwal said “there is enough technology and enough development happening where we don’t have to rely on clean water.” \n\nThe Hindu AI summit 2024 is presented by the SRM Institute of Science & Technology (SRMIST) and powered by Sify, in association with ManageEngine. The Confederation of Indian Industry is the industry partner and CIO Association is the strategic partner. RetailGPT is the phygital commerce partner for the summit; Tamil Nadu Health Systems Project is the healthcare partner and LatentView Analytics is the data analytics partner. Tamil Nadu Technology Hub (iTNT) has been roped in as the digital transformation partner while Tamil Nadu Skill Development Corporation has come in as the skilling partner.

Kansas City Chiefs president Mark Donovan set the record straight on whether Swift and Kelce’s romance is only a marketing ploy to benefit the football team. \"I’d love to say that it was a marketing strategy, but it is an authentic relationship,\" Donovan shared on CNBC’s \"Squawk Box.\" \"And we’re happy to have it, and it’s been nothing but good for us.\" TAYLOR SWIFT, TRAVIS KELCE’S ROMANCE UNDER MICROSCOPE AFTER SINGER SKIPPED LAST TWO GAMES His comments come after the Chiefs' president was asked whether he could have predicted the attention placed on the team after Swift and Kelce started dating. \"I think the best thing I can say about the whole relationship and the impact it’s had on us is, Taylor Swift is an authentic member of the Kansas City Chiefs kingdom,\" Donovan added. \"I’d love to say that it was a marketing strategy, but it is an authentic relationship.\" \"She’s an authentic fan… that matters to our fans and our fan base… it matters to us, and we try to respect that.\" It is no question that Swift has impacted the NFL, helping the professional football organization and the Kansas City Chiefs attain millions of dollars in revenue, according to a marketing expert.

Last month, Swift and Kelce’s romance was under the microscope after the mega pop star skipped two games.

The government plans to establish industrial parks in smaller cities and refine the FDI policy to attract investment and boost manufacturing.",
        "text": "There is a need to raise quality standards in the country and industry needs to tap into its technical committees and appoint representatives to ensure standards are maintained, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said at Ficci's 97th annual general meeting and annual convention. India will not only be a trusted partner but also a provider of quality goods. This will be a potent combination defining our journey towards a Viksit Bharat, Goyal said and asked industry leaders to play a more proactive role and work closely with the government to reduce the compliance burden and decriminalise laws detrimental to businesses.He also said that 1 lakh crore allotted by the government under the newly operationalised Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) should be utilised by the industry to foster innovation and create a research-based ecosystem in the country.At the same event, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) secretary Amardeep Singh Bhatia said the government will facilitate the setting up of more industrial parks in smaller cities and a framework for this should be ready by the year-end. We are facilitating industrial parks in tier-2 and -3 cities for which we have had consultation with industry and framework will be ready this year, and would help industry take care of the land requirements at a reasonable cost as well as modern facilities akin to plug-and-play facilities to set up their units in a shorter time frame, he said.Bhatia said the government is also fine tuning the FDl policy though around 90% of the sectors are on automatic route. FDI doesn't come alone, it also comes with linkages with global value chains and access to markets. We are also pushing for deeptech startups to be facilitated by looking at their long-term financing needs, he said.At present, there are 153,000 registered startups.Noting that India lost a window of opportunity in 1980s and 1990s to manufacture, he said that 1.46 lakh crore of investment has come in the PLI sectors and 4 lakh crore of exports have taken place.",

        "summary": "Punching a protester wasn’t the only thing the former deputy prime minister was known for",
        "text": "Ex-deputy prime minister John Prescott made headlines over the years not just because of the job he was in but also for his entertainment value. A blunt speaker who frequently mangled sentences, he rarely took himself too seriously.\n\nAs tributes are paid across the political spectrum to the Labour stalwart, these are some of the moments that showed he was able to make light of most situations – except when his temper flared.\n\nOn the campaign trail for the party leadership in 1994, Mr Prescott downed a pint in five seconds as he cemented his reputation as a man of the people.\n\nOn a visit to a training centre for the catering and brewing industry in east London, he was urged to show how fast he could do it, winning cheers when it was done.\n\nIce breaker\n\nAt the Brit Awards in 1998, a member of punk rock band Chumbawamba threw iced water over Mr Prescott.\n\nDanbert Nobacon said he did it because “people talk about New Labour being wonderful, but they are an illusion and say the same things as everyone else, but with bigger smiles and sharper suits”.\n\nPolice were called to the London Arena, and Mr Prescott considered pressing charges, branding the attack “utterly contemptible”.\n\nWhen presenting a prize at the British Soap Awards the following year, the politician said: “I was a little apprehensive, I had to make sure Chumbawamba weren’t here.\n\n“I didn’t know whether to put on a dinner suit or a wetsuit.”\n\nIn 2001 the then deputy prime minister punched a protester who had thrown an egg at him during an election campaign in north Wales.\n\nHe said later: “I was attacked by an individual. In the melee that followed I clearly defended myself.”\n\nTony Blair, then prime minister, played the matter down, saying: “John is John.”\n\nCoupling up\n\nPrescott’s marriage to Pauline, also known as “Tilly”, was, predictably, colourful.\n\nIn her autobiography, she revealed how he proposed to her, when they were young, in a cramped train toilet.\n\n“My oh-so-romantic husband-to-be pushed me into the cramped train toilet. Pressed me up against the basin, he kissed me and blurted, ‘Marry me?’. ’John Prescott,’ I cried indignantly. ‘I see the art of romance isn’t dead, then?’” she wrote.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004 Prescott had an affair with his diary secretary, Tracey Temple. He told The Mirror at the time: “I did have a relationship with her which I regret. It ended some time ago. I have discussed this fully with my wife, Pauline, who is devastated by the news. I would be grateful if Pauline and I can now get on with our lives together.”\n\nWhen his wife found out about the affair, she threw him out of their home, but after their sons arranged a meeting at home - which she initially tried to flee - the couple began to work through their issues.\n\nIn 2011, Lady Prescott told Piers Morgan: “I have not forgiven him and I don’t think I ever will, but I’m not bitter. I think once you become bitter you reach the point of no return. I accepted it.”\n\nGavin and Stacey appearance\n\nIn 2010, Lord Prescott made a cameo appearance in BBC comedy series Gavin and Stacey as Nessa Jenkins’s former flame.\n\nRuth Jones’s character regularly alluded to him as a former lover, once expressing regret that he was not the father of her baby.\n\nLord Prescott played himself as a guest at Nessa’s wedding to Dave Coaches.\n\nHe was filmed entering the church and congratulating Dave.\n\nLord Prescott wrote on his blog that he thoroughly enjoyed the appearance.",

This incident occurred approximately 25km from the race’s finish line.\n\nAccording to race officials, Weylandt’s left pedal had become lodged against a wall at the roadside, causing him to fall roughly 20 metres to the ground.\n\nRace doctors provided emergency medical care, and he was slated for airlift to the hospital, but had to wait as an emergency helicopter looked for an appropriate landing area.\n\n“His heart has stopped beating,” was the announcement made by Auro Bulbarelli, head of sport for RAI television, who was the first to deliver the heartbreaking update.\n\nThe news understandably left Weylandt’s Leopard-Trek team, which includes Australia’s Stuart O’Grady and the Schleck brothers Andy and Frank, devastated.\n\n“Today, our teammate and friend Wouter Weylandt passed away after a crash on the third stage of the Giro d’Italia,” stated Leopard-Trek Manager Brian Nygaard.\n\n“The team is reeling in shock and sorrow, and we extend our deepest condolences and thoughts to Wouter’s family and friends.”\n\n“This is a challenging day for cycling and for our team, and we must draw support and strength from those close to us.”\n\nWeylandt, who turned professional in 2006, dedicated most of his career to the Belgian team Quick Step and was the victor of the third stage of the race last year in Middelburg, Netherlands.\n\nSince Kazakhstan’s Andrei Kivilev passed away due to head injuries after a crash on the second stage of Paris-Nice, Weylandt is the first rider to have died in a crash while racing.\n\nHailing from Ghent, Weylandt is the first casualty on the Giro since 1986 when Emilio Ravasio was involved in a crash on the first stage and fell into a coma, ultimately dying several days later.\n\nIn light of this tragedy, race organizers opted to cancel the post-race ceremony in Rapallo, where Spaniard Angel Vicioso of the Androni team had won the stage ahead of David Millar from Britain (Garmin), the new race leader.\n\nby Buford Balony",

        "text": "Connie Nielsen joined \"CBS Mornings\" to discuss stepping back into the world of \"Gladiator\" to reprise the beloved role of the character Lucilla, 24 years after the original film.\"I was nervous,\" she said. \"People really, really, really feel protective, I think, about the first one. A lot of people have been saying to me on the streets, 'Don't do number two, because number one is so perfect.'\"Nielsen explained that her decision to return hinged on the quality of the \"Gladiator II\" script. \"We were obviously wanting to make sure that the script was going to be amazing,\" she said. Her agents reassured her it was after speaking with producers. \"They were like, 'Just tell her she's going to be happy.'\"Reflecting on her character's evolution, Nielsen expressed gratitude for the opportunity to portray a more mature Lucilla. \"I played that as a young woman, and it's incredible to get the opportunity to show or go through the story of what happened to her over almost half a lifetime,\" she said. \"To get to tell that story and to get to show like what this mature Lucilla like — who has she grown into?\"Nielsen praised director Ridley Scott for his collaborative approach. \"Ridley is expecting you—he's counting on you, he's casting you because he wants you to be part of telling the story,\" she said. \"He makes you feel like there's a lot of space for you creatively.\"She also reflected on the on-screen tension during her character Lucilla's first meeting with her long-lost son Lucius, played by Paul Mescal. \"We didn't really talk until we'd filmed that scene,\" Nielsen said. \"I'm coming from the perspective of a mother who made the ultimate sacrifice to save her son's life ... For him, the narrative is, 'How could you abandon me?'\" \"Gladiator II\" is distributed by Paramount Pictures, which is part of CBS' parent company, Paramount Global. \"Gladiator II\" hits theaters on Friday, Nov. 22.",

        "summary": "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose 2.9% compared with October last year, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.",
        "text": "US housing’s first annual sales gain in more than three years didn’t impress Molly Boesel, principal economist at CoreLogic.\n\n“The housing market is on track for its worst year in more than a decade,” she said in a statement. “The good news is, there’s nowhere to go but up. However, stubbornly high mortgage rates and strong home prices will continue to weigh down on the housing recovery. Any potential thaw in the housing market will likely happen only after the pending winter months.”\n\nSales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose 2.9% compared with October last year, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The first year-over-year gain since July 2021 came as transactions ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million.\n\nHome prices increased on an annual basis for the 16th consecutive month. The national median sales price rose 4% from a year earlier, to $407,200.\n\n“The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” said Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist.\n\nStill, with just two more months left to go this year, existing home sales are on track for the lowest annual home sales since 1995, Yun said.\n\nThe U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Existing home sales sank to a nearly 30-year low last year as the average rate on a 30-year mortgage surged to a 23-year high of nearly 8%, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.\n\nThe average rate on a 30-year mortgage fell to a two-year low of 6.08% in September, when likely many of the purchase contracts on homes that officially sold in October were signed. But it’s been mostly rising since then, reaching 6.84% this week.\n\nEconomists predict that mortgage rates will remain volatile this year, but generally forecast them to hover around 6% in 2025.\n\nThat may not be attractive enough to entice current homeowners who bought or refinanced to rock-bottom rates from selling. More than 4 in 5 homeowners with a mortgage have an existing rate below 6%, according to Realtor.com.\n\nMore options\n\nA wider selection of properties on the market as sales slowed this year has been a bright spot for home shoppers. There were 1.37 million unsold homes at the end of October, up 0.7% from September and 19.1% from October last year, NAR said.\n\nThat translates to a 4.2-month supply at the current sales pace, which is down from 4.3 months in September, but up from a 3.6-month pace at the end of October last year. Traditionally, a 5- to 6-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers.\n\nAnother factor helping lift the inventory of homes on the market: Properties are taking longer to sell than a year ago.\n\nHomes typically stayed on the market for 29 days last month before they were sold, up from 28 days in September and 23 days in October last year.\n\nWhile the number of homes for sale has been increasing this year, the housing market inventory remains well below its pre-pandemic levels. Consider, there were about 1.8 million unsold homes on the market in October 2019.\n\n“We still need another 30% growth in inventory to get us back to pre-COVID conditions,” Yun said.\n\nStretched buyers\n\nLimited inventory, especially in the more affordable price range of a given market, helps drive prices higher. That’s one reason first-time homebuyers, who don’t have any home equity to put toward their down payment, continue to struggle to afford a home.\n\nThey accounted for just 27% of all homes sold last month. That’s up from 26% in September, but down from 28% in October last year. First-time buyers have accounted for 40% of sales historically.\n\nHomebuyers who can afford to sidestep mortgage rates and pay all cash for a home accounted for 27% of sales last month, down from 29% a year earlier.\n\nWhile existing homeowners have overcome rising mortgage rates and home prices by using their strong home equity gains, first-time buyers have had to save longer for a down payment, often delaying when they buy their first home by several years.\n\nIt’s why Americans who can afford to buy a home are skewing older. The median age of homebuyers between July 2023 and last June climbed to 56, the highest on records going back to 1981, according to NAR. First-time buyers’ median age rose to 38 in the same period. Historically, the median age of U.S. homebuyers overall has averaged about 44.\n\nJonathan Lansner of the Southern California News Group added to this report.",

One Florida Senate seat will likely be open for appointment by DeSantis as Trump announced he is nominating Sen. Marco Rubio to be secretary of state. DeSantis could technically appoint Gaetz to that seat as he has no current role in Congress, but DeSantis said on Monday he has “already received strong interest from several possible candidates, and we continue to gather names of additional candidates and conduct preliminary vetting.” He said vetting would continue through the coming weeks and he expects a selection to be made in early January.\n\nFurther Reading\nForbesGaetz Resigns From House Before Ethics Report Can Be ReleasedBy Antonio Pequeño IV\n\nForbesTrump’s Cabinet And Key Jobs: Matthew Whitaker Tapped As NATO Ambassador—As Trump Backs Gaetz Despite AllegationsBy Sara DornForbes‘Shocked At The Nomination’: Gaetz As Attorney General Pick Stuns Members Of CongressBy Antonio Pequeño IVverifythis.comNo, Matt Gaetz is not guaranteed to get his House seat back after withdrawing from AG consideration\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

        "summary": "During his address to the Parliament of Guyana, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi advocated for international collaboration in space and maritime domains.  He emphasized India's commitment to global partnership and support for developing nations, contrasting it with self-serving expansionist approaches. Modi highlighted the importance of democracy and prioritizing human welfare in shaping a new world order.",
        "text": "In a message to big power rivalry in outer space and oceans,PM Narendra Modi on Thursday said that space and sea should be subjects of universal cooperation , not universal conflict. In his address at a Special Session of Parliament of Guyana in Georgetown, the PM noted that India's mantra of 'Humanity First' inspires it to amplify the voice of the Global South, including at the recent G-20 Summit in Brazil.India, he further noted, wants to serve humanity as Vishwabandhu, a friend to the world, and this seminal thought has shaped its approach towards the global community where it gives equal importance to all nations-big or small. In a subtle message to the Chinese approach to resource rich countries, Modi also said India has never moved forward with selfishness, expansionist attitude , and it has always been away from harbouring any feeling of seizing resources. For the world to move forward, the biggest mantra is 'Democracy First, Humanity First'. The spirit of democracy first teaches us to take everyone along and participate in everyone's development. 'Humanity First' guides our decision-making. When we make 'Humanity First' the basis of our decision-making, the results are also ones which benefit humanity, he said.The PM also pointed out that it is time for awakening of the Global South , and for its members to come together to create a new global order.In his remarks, Modi termed the India-Guyana ties of 'mitti' (soil) as full of cordiality, referring to their cultural ties of over a century and a half.",

        "title": "Trump Cabinet picks hover over the search for Vance's Senate successor in Ohio",
        "summary": "Whoever Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine picks to replace JD Vance in the Senate will face a battery of Trump loyalty tests on backing embattled Cabinet picks like Matt Gaetz, Pete Hegseth and more.",
        "text": "The search for Vice President-elect JD Vance’s successor in the Senate is reinforcing a rift among Ohio Republicans, whose loyalties are divided between the establishment-friendly Gov. Mike DeWine and President-elect Donald Trump. DeWine, who endorsed against a Trump-backed candidate this year in the race for Ohio’s other Senate seat, will appoint someone to fill Vance’s seat at least until a 2026 special election for the final two years of the term Vance won in 2022. Contenders already are lobbying him hard. “His phone,” DeWine spokesperson Dan Tierney told NBC News, “has been ringing off the hook.” DeWine has said he prefers to choose someone who can win a GOP primary in two years. And the person he selects will likely face a quick battery of loyalty tests with Trump, Vance and the voters who gave them a landslide victory in Ohio: tough confirmation fights for several of Trump’s expected Cabinet nominees. For defense secretary, Trump wants Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host who has said women shouldn’t serve in combat and who has been accused of, but never charged with, sexual assault. Trump also intends to nominate anti-vaccination activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health and human services secretary and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who has been accused of amplifying Russian propaganda, as director of national intelligence. And Trump had planned to nominate as attorney general former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who was investigated by the Justice Department, but not charged, in a case that involved allegations of sex trafficking. Gaetz withdrew from consideration Thursday afternoon. Vance has consulted with DeWine on the Senate appointment, two sources familiar with the discussions said. He also accompanied Gaetz and Hegseth to their meetings with other senators this week while posting on social media that Trump’s win entitles him to “a cabinet that is loyal to the agenda he was elected to implement.” Those close to Trump and Vance, meanwhile, are closely monitoring how Vance’s potential successors handle questions about Trump’s picks. “We’re not expecting someone to be appointed who is as ideologically connected to President Trump’s agenda as JD was, but there is an expectation that whoever gets it is broadly supportive of his policies, and publicly supporting his Cabinet nominees should be a given for anyone who wants the job,” said a high-ranking Trump world operative, who was granted anonymity to share internal thinking. Some of the prospects to replace Vance are being careful with what they say about Trump’s embattled picks — if they say anything at all. Of nine Republicans who are seeking or are being mentioned for the appointment, only four responded when asked if they support Gaetz, Gabbard, Hegseth and Kennedy. (Each of the Senate prospects who responded to questions did so before Gaetz withdrew from consideration for attorney general.) “President-elect Trump deserves to have the people he wants in his Cabinet, and his nominations are fully in line with his promise to shake up Washington, which is why I support him,” state Treasurer Robert Sprague, who avoided making any explicit endorsements, said in a statement shared by a spokesperson. “Each of his nominees will undergo the deliberative scrutiny of the U.S. Senate confirmation process. In doing its constitutional confirmation duty, I believe a Senate confirmation ensures a cabinet worthy of the public trust.” Another potential appointee, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, is “very supportive of the team being put together by [Trump and Vance] and excited about what they’ll be able to accomplish,” his spokesperson, Dan Lusheck, said. Pressed further, Lusheck confirmed that LaRose would support the nominations of Gaetz, Gabbard, Hegseth and Kennedy. Rep. Mike Carey, whose relationships with DeWine and Trump make him a top prospect, could be a tougher sell. Carey said in an interview last week with Spectrum News that Trump’s choice of Gaetz to lead the Justice Department “surprised him” and that he did not believe Gaetz would be confirmed. “I just don’t see that happening,” Carey told Spectrum. (He did not respond to a request for comment for this article.) Two lesser-known prospects offered enthusiastic and unequivocal endorsements. “I’d proudly support ALL of President Trump’s nominees,” state Rep. Jay Edwards wrote in a text message. “Any Republican that would hesitate on this question misunderstood the mandate the people delivered on November 5.” Mehek Cooke, an attorney who served in former Gov. John Kasich’s administration and worked on the campaign against a successful constitutional amendment to codify abortion rights in Ohio, pledged to “firmly support [Trump’s] bold Cabinet selections, chosen to serve the people — not political agendas.” “Anyone, Republican or Democrat, who obstructs this vision has no place in Washington,” Cooke added. Among those who did not respond to questions about Trump’s picks was Jane Timken, a Republican National Committee member and former state party chair who is viewed by many GOP operatives in the state as a leading candidate. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted — who has been preparing to run for governor when DeWine is term-limited in 2026 but has not ruled out accepting the Senate appointment — declined to comment. DeWine is prepared to move quickly with an appointment, though Vance has not indicated when he will resign from the Senate. If possible, DeWine would like to have the pick seated before Jan. 3, when the next term begins, ensuring that Vance’s successor would have more seniority than freshman senators elected in November, Tierney, the governor’s spokesperson, said. GOP operatives in Ohio have long speculated that DeWine could use the appointment to help clear the primary field for Husted’s bid for governor, perhaps by choosing Sprague, who has shown interest in that race, or state Attorney General Dave Yost. But Yost, who this week posted a video teasing his imminent campaign for governor, does not want the appointment, a source close to him said. Another potential Husted rival in 2026, Vivek Ramaswamy, took himself out of the running for the Senate seat after Trump tapped him to lead a government efficiency project with billionaire Elon Musk. A former senator himself, DeWine is prioritizing several qualities in his search for Vance’s successor, Tierney said. He wants someone who is serious about policy and legislating — not someone more focused on performative politics. He also prefers a candidate who could serve a long time, meaning that he’s not planning to appoint a “caretaker” who would agree not to run for the seat in the 2026 special election. When asked if Trump’s Cabinet picks were a part of DeWine’s considerations, Tierney emphasized the governor’s wish that his pick be able to win the GOP primary that year. “The governor wants his choice to be ratified by voters in a Republican primary, and the governor wants his choice to be ratified by voters in a general election — and then again in two years,” Tierney said. That calculus could work against several of the hopefuls, including Timken, who finished a distant fifth behind Vance and others in a 2022 Senate primary; LaRose, who finished last in this year’s Senate primary; and state Sen. Matt Dolan, a losing candidate in both of those primaries. DeWine endorsed Dolan in this year’s race, putting the governor at odds with Trump, who backed businessman Bernie Moreno. Moreno beat Dolan and LaRose easily and then went on to unseat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Dolan, whose advisers did not respond to requests for comment, is seeking the appointment. But Republicans close to DeWine are skeptical that the governor would appoint someone voters have already rejected in a previous race, even after DeWine's endorsement. Moreno, for his part, singled out Gaetz, Gabbard, Hegseth and Kennedy this week in a statement pledging to support Trump’s Cabinet choices. “The American people delivered President Trump a mandate, and it is crucial that Senate Republicans confirm his nominees quickly,” he said. “Our Republican majority must unite and deliver a strong cabinet so we can begin implementing the America-First agenda as soon as possible.”",

I love it so much,\" she exclaimed to co-host Jenna Bush Hager. It wasn't long before Hager, 42, got to the real question: \"Have you gotten in there just to hide from your children yet?\"Kotb, who adopted Haley in 2017 and Hope in 2019, nodded her head and revealed that the day before, \"I cased out my own house. I sat outside and I didn't go in... But I was in the car. So I was casing and waiting.\" She explained that sometimes she needs a moment before walking inside because \"the minute I go in, I can't do anything.\"Hager, who has three kids of her own — she shares daughters Mila, 11, and Poppy, 9, as well as son Hal, 5, with husband Henry Hager — could relate. \"You'll find yourself sitting in cars, listening to music, having just some alone time,\" she said. \"And wait, you're like, 'OK, maybe just one more song. One more song and I'll go.'\"Laughing, Kotb agreed. \"Sometimes you need that time,\" she said, adding, \"You reset. And then you're ready.\"The Today host's love for her car is no secret. She announced the purchase last week on the Thursday, November 14 episode and couldn't hide her excitement. \"Guys, I'm getting a minivan! A Toyota Sienna!\" she exclaimed. \"I'm so excited. I have wanted a Toyota Sienna for a long time.\"The move fits perfectly into Kotb's new suburban lifestyle after her move from New York City to the suburbs earlier this year. \"It's all new — new kids, new school, new things, new everything,\" Kotb said about the milestone move on Today in August. \"All I could think of was I want my house for the kids to feel warm and cozy and a place where they want to hang.\"Kotb's new minivan purchase comes just weeks after she announced her plans to leave Today after more than 16 years with the hit morning show. In an emotional moment on Thursday, September 26, the longtime anchor explained her decision to \"turn the page\" as she approaches her next chapter.\"I started thinking about that decade. Like, what does that decade mean, what does it hold and what's it going to have for me?\" she shared, adding that her departure will allow her to spend more time with her family.Kotb's final show is set for January 10, 2025 — she will be replaced by Craig Melvin.",

Some guy called Alan replied asking me to send in an acoustic version of myself singing sonnet by the verve.\" He continued: \"Do us a favour lads and just give the @samaritans some dosh at least Merry Xmas.\"\n\nIt comes after it was announced the department store were on the hunt for aspiring artists to take centre stage in the ad for their Christmas day version. The winner - chosen by Richard Ashcroft and a panel of judges - will record their own version of Sonnet, which will be featured in the ad on December 25.\n\nJon's tune, which has seen people post videos of themselves singing the catchy \"sweet apple crumble\" line and has a campaign going to get it to Christmas number one, is supporting Samaritans. Jon posted on his social media platform that the lyric was initially just a joke line, but his since became a favourite by fans. \n\nHe wrote: \"The lyrics taken over the nation. But it’s actually the only one that isn’t mine. It was @dannylafrombe being daft and we ended up leaving it in cos it sounded so hooky. Love all your video la of people belting that line out in random places. And even more importantly than that keep donating and raising awareness for the amazing @samaritans.\"\n\nThis year's John Lewis advert received a mixed response online when it was released last week. This year, the advert focuses on the story of the bond between two sisters. The department store has chosen to go back to basics after last year’s Christmas advert star, Snapper the Venus flytrap, and for the first time ever, the advert features an actual John Lewis store.\n\nThe story begins with Sally, who makes a last minute dash into the store in search of a present for her sibling. A store colleague announces there are only five minutes left until the store, leaving Sally to frantically hunt for the perfect present, only to fall through a rack of designer dresses as memories of the siblings’ lives together flash before her eyes.\n\nDespite some positive responses, others complained. One X user wrote: \"It doesn’t quite have that John Lewis sparkle than past adverts have had,” while another moaned: “That’s it, Christmas is ruined. The John Lewis ad is quite comfortably the worst one yet.”\n\n*If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

        "summary": "Eruption adds a new meaning to hot springs.",
        "text": "A volcano in southwestern Iceland that has roared back to life after eight centuries of silence has erupted for the seventh time since December, sending molten lava flowing towards the Blue Lagoon spa, a major tourist attraction.\n\nThe eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula started with little warning at 11:14 p.m. (2314 GMT) Wednesday and created a fissure around 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) long. \n\nThe activity is estimated to be considerably smaller than the previous eruption in August, according to Iceland’s meteorological office that monitors seismic activity.\n\nMost of the previous eruptions have subsided within days.\n\n“In the big picture, this is a bit smaller than the last eruption, and the eruption that occurred in May,” Magnús Tumi Guðmundsson, a professor of geophysics who flew over the scene with the Civil Protection agency to monitor the event, told national broadcaster RUV.\n\nWhile the eruption poses no threat to air travel, authorities warned of gas emissions across parts of the peninsula, including the nearby town of Grindavík, which was largely evacuated a year ago when the volcano came to life after lying dormant for 800 years.\n\nAround 50 houses were evacuated after the Civil Protection Agency issued the alert, along with guests at the Blue Lagoon. By Thursday afternoon lava had spread across the parking lot of the geothermal spa, one of Iceland’s biggest tourist attractions, consuming a service building.\n\nLava also reached the pipeline that supplies the peninsula with hot water for heating, the meteorological office said, though the pipes were built to withstand lava flow.\n\nThe repeated volcanic eruptions close to Grindavík, which is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, and had a population before the eruptions of 3,800, have damaged infrastructure and property, forcing many residents to relocate to guarantee their safety.\n\n“Grindavík is not in danger as it looks and it is unlikely that this crack will get any longer, although nothing can be ruled out,” Magnús Tumi said.\n\nIceland, which sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic, averages one eruption every four to five years. \n\nThe most disruptive in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.",

        "text": "A new report from Resy digs into the food and dining trends of the past year — as well as which restaurants in the Big Apple take the cake as the most beloved.\n\nThe reservation platform, which analyzed booking data and diner surveys to compile the report, dished the New York City hotspots that are rebooked the most, with Balthazar, Café Chelsea, L’Artusi, Pastis and Thai Diner leading the pack.\n\n“Between personal greetings from restaurant staff, ‘extras’ that can appear on your table and knowing your way around the menu, there’s no joy for a restaurant-lover quite like becoming a regular – and restaurants depend on regulars to help keep their business afloat,” the report reads.\n\nWhile it is nearly impossible to snag a table at one of Gotham’s many trendy and tasty digs, Resy has seen a spike in interest for Sunday reservations. \n\nThe company’s data showed a high percentage of “Notifies” — alerts for available dining times — converted to real-life reservations on Sundays, with patrons 19% more likely to get a slot that day compared to Saturday. \n\nAnd across the five boroughs, patrons are most likely to convert their reservation alerts to a seat at a table at the Williamsburg eatery Birds of a Feather.\n\nWhen choosing which restaurant to book, those who love to “yap” — or who have a knack for talking your ear off — outlined the ideal ambiance for chitchat with their pals.\n\nOf the 81% of respondents who self-identified as “yappers,” 66% said a “staff with good vibes” is necessary to set the mood for dinner, while 64% required “a good happy hour deal,” 61% need “an atmosphere that isn’t too loud” and 60% preferred booth seating as an option.\n\nIn general, the “overall vibes” played a key role when dining out, with 38% of patrons admitting it was one of the main reasons for deciding where to eat. \n\nIn fact, 23% of people said they would visit a wine or cocktail bar “just for the vibes” — despite not being big drinkers — and 46% of people draw interior design inspiration from restaurant decor.\n\nAdditionally, 88% of people said the chances of booking a table increase if the staff seems like they have “good vibes,” while more than half of diners said they are more likely to snag a reservation based on photos of a restaurant.\n\nDespite the meteoric rise of solo dining over the past year — which saw a 6% surge in NYC alone, per Resy — restaurants are still considered a “prime place for connecting,” with nearly half of patrons saying they would converse with strangers at an eatery.\n\nNot to mention, restaurants — especially ones that go viral on social media — are tourist hotspots.\n\nAccording to Resy, 67% of people surveyed said they would travel domestically to another city just to try a new restaurant.\n\nAnd, speaking of online sensations, the Resy editorial team weighed in on the hottest trends going into the new year, predicting that omakase and raw bars will reign supreme in 2025 alongside the return of the pub burger and cabbage usurping cauliflower as the most popular vegetable.\n\nThe Resy team also predicted that “snack-tails” — a cocktail-snack hybrid referring to alcoholic beverages with elaborate garnishes — will become the hot new to-do, and so will nostalgia dining, which comes amid a wave of restaurants reviving old menu items.",

        "text": "A high-ranking Mexican cartel leader who faked his own death to \"live a life of luxury\" in California has been arrested and charged with drug trafficking, U.S. officials said Thursday. Cristian Fernando Gutierrez-Ochoa was arrested in Riverside, California, on Tuesday, the Justice Department said in a statement.Gutierrez-Ochoa is the son-in-law of Nemesio Oseguera-Cervantes, 58, also known as \"El Mencho,\" the leader of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which the officials described as \"one of the world's most violent and prolific drug trafficking organizations.\"Nicole Argentieri, a senior Justice Department official, said Gutierrez-Ochoa \"allegedly directed the importation of tons of methamphetamine and cocaine into the United States and engaged in violence to aid the cartel's criminal activities.\"Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Gutierrez-Ochoa \"allegedly faked his own death and assumed a false identity to evade justice and live a life of luxury in California.\"According to court documents, Gutierrez-Ochoa began working for the Jalisco cartel in 2014 and coordinated the shipment of 40,000 kilograms (88,000 pounds) of methamphetamine and 2,000 kilograms of cocaine from Mexico to the United States.In 2021, he allegedly kidnapped two members of the Mexican navy in an attempt to secure the release of Oseguera-Cervantes's wife, who had been arrested by the Mexican authorities.Oseguera-Cervantes, the Jalisco cartel founder, has also been indicted in the United States and the State Department has offered a $10 million reward for his capture.In December 2022, the Mexican army captured Antonio Oseguera, the brother of \"El Mencho.\" He allegedly oversaw violent actions and logistics, and bought weapons and laundered money for the Jalisco cartel. The U.S. Treasury Department listed Antonio Oseguera's alias as \"El Tony Montana,\" an apparent reference to the fictional protagonist of the 1983 gangster film \"Scarface.\"The Jalisco cartel is better known for producing millions of doses of deadly fentanyl and smuggling them into the United States disguised to look like Xanax, Percocet or oxycodone. Such pills cause about 70,000 overdose deaths per year in the United States.\"Defeating the two cartels responsible for the deadly drug crisis in the United States is the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)'s top operational priority, and with the arrest of Cristian Fernando Gutierrez-Ochoa, we are much closer,\" DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a statement.Earlier this year, the U.S. imposed sanctions on a group of Mexican accountants and firms allegedly linked to a timeshare fraud ring run by the Jalisco cartel in a multi-million dollar scheme targeting Americans.",

I was in fear so I picked up the knife”, rejected the defendant’s case that he was provoked. \n\nThe 12 jurors at the Central Criminal Court deliberated for just two hours and two minutes before returning the unanimous verdict today against Murphy (52) who had accepted that he killed his friend, Joseph Brosnan.\n\nMr Murphy, of no fixed abode, had pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Brosnan, at Abbey Court, Tralee, on 22 May 2022. \n\nThe trial heard the deceased man had lived in an apartment at Abbey Court. He had previously worked in a direct provision centre on the outskirts of town and there he met and befriended Polish national Kamil Lisowski.\n\nMr Brosnan helped Mr Lisowski settle in and move from apartment to apartment and they became good friends, prosecution counsel Patrick Gageby SC told the jury.\n\nOn the date in question, Mr Lisowski finished work at about a quarter to eight in the morning and called on his friend Mr Brosnan.\n\nMr Gageby said drink was taken and the pair sat and watched television together.\n\nAt around 3pm that afternoon, Mr Murphy called over to Mr Brosnan’s home. Further drinking took place in the house which resulted in some insult passing between Mr Lisowski and Mr Murphy, counsel told the jury.\n\n“It fizzled out but not before Mr Lisowski had slapped Mr Murphy in the face,” said Mr Gageby.\n\nThings calmed down and people shook hands but the matter “welled up again” and Patrick Murphy was asked to leave.\n\nThe barrister said at around a quarter to seven that evening, Patrick Murphy returned and apologised. He said the jury will hear that Mr Murphy was “pushed out vigorously” of the apartment and fell to the ground outside.\n\nA short time later Mr Brosnan opened the door to Mr Murphy again and told the accused to go.\n\nCounsel said Mr Murphy was “armed with quite a large kitchen knife and used it to stab Mr Brosnan”.\n\nThe deceased was stabbed three times, with a second stab wound to Mr Brosnan’s back proving fatal because it penetrated the pericardial sac around the deceased’s heart which caused massive bleeding and resulted in death occurring “fairly rapidly”.\n\nCounsel said Mr Brosnan “was well aware that he was seriously injured and announced to Mr Lisowski: ‘I’m dying’”.\n\n“Ambulance and gardai were called but unfortunately he [Mr Brosnan] died in his apartment lying on his sofa,” said Mr Gageby.\n\nThe prosecution case was that Murphy had “a clear intention to kill or cause serious injury”.\n\nThe jury also heard from a number of gardaí, including Garda James Fairbrother who spoke to Mr Murphy at the scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurphy told the garda that he was “a peacemaker and he didn’t know who had stabbed the deceased”.\n\nWhen he was arrested and interviewed, Murphy suggested that the victim had possibly suffered a seizure before eventually admitting that he had brought a knife to the scene and that he had stabbed Mr Brosnan.\n\nOutlining a summary of the evidence in the case yesterday, trial judge Mr Justice Paul Burns reminded the jury that they had heard evidence from residents who said they heard arguing from the vicinity of Mr Brosnan’s apartment, with one woman saying she saw Murphy holding a knife in his hand.\n\nThe woman said Murphy “wasn’t in this world”, as his eyes were “real big” and he looked confused.\n\nAnother witness said she heard glass breaking and saw a man with a rock and a knife, while further evidence was given by a waitress from a nearby restaurant, who said she could see and hear a man shouting and screaming at the door of the apartment, describing him as “going psychotic”. \n\nKamil Lisowski also gave evidence to the trial, telling the jury that Murphy had come to the door “to revenge” and had stabbed Mr Brosnan “like rapid fire”\n\n“My best friend was dying in my hands,” the eyewitness told the jury.\n\nThe jury heard that Murphy told gardai that he started drinking and taking tablets before numerous scuffles broke out on the day. \n\n“At some stage, I was being beaten. A knife was produced. I was feeling out of it, and I picked up a knife to defend myself. I didn’t mean to stab Joe,” Murphy said in garda interview. \n\nMurphy said that the group had been drinking brandy, vodka and wine, while he had also been taking tablets and sharing them around. \n\n“I know it was me. I had the knife. I know I was the one with the knife,” Murphy told gardaí, going on to say that Mr Brosnan was a friend of his all his life. \n\n“Look, I had the knife, I am responsible. I was in fear so I picked up the knife. I don’t remember stabbing Joe, but I must have. I remember jabbing back with the knife,” he said, going on to say that he would not have harmed Mr Brosnan on purpose. \n\nIt had been the defence’s case that Murphy was “provoked” into stabbing his daughter’s neighbour “in boiling blood”.\n\nMr Brendan Grehan SC for the defence said that witnesses saw Murphy “pacing around” with a knife and a rock in each hand in “an agitated state”. He said Murphy had “acted in boiling blood, in a rage or out of control”.\n\nMr Grehan said that “something must have happened to cause that to occur” and claimed the causing factor was that he “had the living daylights kicked out of him on the ground”. Mr Grehan suggested that it was Mr Lisowski and possibly Mr Brosnan who hit him on the ground in this instance, driving him into a rage, despite denials of this by Mr Lisowski.\n\nHe said: “that beating by Mr Lisowski and perhaps Joseph Brosnan was an act of provocation”.\n\nBefore beginning their deliberations, Mr Justice Burns told the jury that there were two verdicts open to them, guilty of murder, or not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. He also said that their verdict must be unanimous. \n\nAfter the jury of eight men and four women returned their verdict, Mr Justice Burns thanked them for their time and attention during the trial, excusing them from jury service for the next seven years. \n\nThe matter was adjourned to 16 December for victim impact statements and sentencing, with Murphy remanded in custody.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nFionnuala Walsh\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Man who stabbed his friend to death 'in boiling blood' convicted of murder ”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Man who stabbed his friend to death 'in boiling blood' convicted of murder ”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\ncentral crimiinal court\n\nNews in 60 seconds\n\nLive TV debate on sports policies to take place ahead of General Election\n\n30 mins ago\n\nyour stories\nIf you've emigrated, what would the next government have to promise to entice you to come home?\n\n38 mins ago\n\nUS politics\nDonald Trump's attorney general pick Matt Gaetz withdraws from consideration\n\n40 mins ago\n\nAdvertising Standards Authority\nPhoneWatch ad complaint upheld over lack of evidence that its alarms are 'most feared' by burglars\n\n50 mins ago\n\n GE2024 Emergency Accommodation\nDarragh O’Brien criticised for not publishing homelessness figures before election\n\n53 mins ago\n\nMan found in possession of over 1.2 million images of child sexual abuse material jailed\n\n Podcast The Candidate\nThis election was supposed to be a disaster for Sinn Féin\n\nSnow warnings start to kick in as country braces itself for drop in temperatures \n\nWeather Forecast\nStorm Bert: Nationwide wind and rain alert tomorrow; three counties face weekend Orange rain warning\n\nAs it happened\nSnow and rain impacted transport and power across West, Midlands and South-West\n\ndublin riots\n18 people identified after gardaí release photos from Dublin riot investigation\n\nmore from us\n\nInvestigates\n\nDaft.ie Property Magazine\n\nAllianz Home Magazine\n\nMoney Diaries\n\nThe Journal TV\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nAbout FactCheck\n\nOur Network\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nmore from us\n\nTV Listings\n\nGAA Fixtures\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nOur Network\n\nThe Journal\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\n© 2024 Journal Media Ltd\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nSwitch to Desktop\nSwitch to Mobile\n\nThe Journal supports the work of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, and our staff operate within the Code of Practice.

        "text": "The conviction of actor-singer Jussie Smollett, who was found guilty of falsely reporting a hate crime against him in 2019, was overturned by an Illinois court.\n\nThursday’s reversal comes three years after Smollett was convicted in 2021.\n\nSmollett, 39, is best known for his role in the Fox drama series Empire, in which he played the role of Jamal Lyon for four years from 2015. The role won him several accolades for his portrayal of a gay, Black musician. While he was renewed for a new season of Empire in 2019, he did not appear in any episodes. \n\nHis other notable films as an actor include Ridley Scott’s Alien: Covenant (2017) and Marshall (2017). \n\nHe made headlines in January 2019 after the actor, who is Black and gay, claimed two men assaulted him, put a noose around his neck and launched racial and homophobic slurs at him. \n\nAfter some legal rigmarole, prosecutors alleged the attack was staged. A jury found him guilty of five charges of disorderly conduct and he was sentenced to 150 days in jail, 30 months of probation and ordered to pay roughly $130,000 in restitution. \n\nHe only served six days behind bars before he was freed pending an appeal. \n\nIn 2019, he was charged with felony disorderly conduct after prosecutors said that he lied about an alleged hate crime in downtown Chicago.\n\nSmollett had told the police that on the morning of 29 January 2019, he was walking home when two men who recognized him from Empire started hurling racist and homophobic abuses at him.\n\nThe actor said the two men then proceeded to hit him and hooked a makeshift noose around his neck and said, “This is MAGA country,” referring to then-president Donald Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again”.\n\nThe actor also alleged that he had received a racist and homophobic letter on the set of Empire.\n\nIn February 2019, Chicago police said Smollett had staged the attack to get publicity and a better salary. Shortly after the police announced they had arrested two persons of interest in the case, evidence emerged that prompted authorities to shift “the trajectory of the investigation.” \n\nDays later, the actor was arrested on one count of filing a false police report.\n\nThe police said that he had sent the letter to himself on the set of Empire and then hired two brothers from Nigeria, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, to pretend to attack him for $3,500. The brothers have sued him for the attack.\n\nThe following month, a grand jury indicted him on 16 felony counts of falsely reporting to police. \n\nReports alleged that the actor tried to use his influence after Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, at the request of former first lady Michelle Obama’s one-time chief of staff, allegedly communicated with a member of Smollett’s family.\n\nFoxx recused herself from the case in February 2019, and her office suddenly dropped the charges the next month. \n\nStill, Chicago police stood by their claims that Smollett had orchestrated the alleged attack and asked him to pay $130,000 to cover the cost of police officers who spent time reviewing video and physical evidence in this case that could have been spent on other investigations.\n\nThe tides changed for Smollett in August 2019, when special prosecutor Dan Webb was appointed to look into the handling of the case. \n\nBy February 2020, the actor was charged with six counts of felony disorderly conduct in February 2020; Smollett pleaded not guilty to all counts. \n\nThe trial was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as a controversy around the prosecutor in the case.\n\nThe charges were reinstated on February 11, 2020, and the actor pleaded not guilty on February 24. He was convicted in December 2021 on five of six counts and acquitted on the sixth.\n\nThe actor initially drew support on social media after the attack but also spurred a political firestorm.\n\nIn the days after the incident, in early February, he released a statement: “The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.” He added: “I am working with authorities and have been 100% factual and consistent on every level.”\n\nWhile Democrats cited it as another example of racism and bigotry under the Trump administration, Republicans alleged that the attack was an attempt to villainize the former president’s supporters as racist.\n\nWhen the claims unraveled, Smollett became a point of ridicule from fellow Black celebrities, including NBA analyst Charles Barkley and comedian Dave Chappelle. \n\nSmollett told the BBC in 2020 that it was not his job “to convince people” and that he and his family have continued to receive threats. “The thing that really gets me is the fact that there are black and brown women and men behind bars for things they did not do,” he said.\n\nSmollett’s appeal hinged on the claim that a special prosecutor should not have been allowed to intervene after the Cook County state’s attorney initially dropped the 16 charges against him having performed community service and forfeited a $10,000 bond.\n\n The state’s highest court heard arguments in September before announcing the decision on November 21. \n\n“We are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,” Justice Elizabeth Rochford wrote in the court’s 5-0 decision. \n\n“Nevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the state was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.” \n\nSmollett’s lawyers welcomed the decision claiming the original prosecution was “vindictive”. \n\n“This was not a prosecution based on facts, rather it was a vindictive persecution and such a proceeding has no place in our criminal justice system,” Smollett’s attorney, Nenye Uche, said in a statement. Uche said “rule of law was the big winner today” and thanked the court for “restoring order to Illinois’ criminal law jurisprudence.”\n\nHowever, the special prosecutor, Dan Webb, said he disagreed with the court’s ruling while noting that it “has nothing to do with Mr. Smollett’s innocence.”\n\n“We are disappointed in the Illinois Supreme Court’s decision today to overturn Jussie Smollett’s convictions and sentence, including the award of over $120,000 in restitution to the City of Chicago for its overtime expenses in investigating Mr. Smollett’s fake hate crime,” Webb said in a statement Thursday after Smollett’s conviction was reversed. \n\n“We respectfully disagree with the Court’s factual and legal reasoning which upends long-standing Illinois precedent,” \n\n“Make no mistake—today’s ruling has nothing to do with Mr. Smollett’s innocence. The Illinois Supreme Court did not find any error with the overwhelming evidence presented at trial that Mr. Smollett orchestrated a fake hate crime and reported it to the Chicago Police Department as a real hate crime, or the jury’s unanimous verdict that Mr. Smollett was guilty of five counts of felony disorderly conduct. \n\n“In fact, Mr. Smollett did not even challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against him in his appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.”\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies",

        "summary": "Dylan Thomas, 24, brutally murdered William Bush, 23, at the home they shared in Llandaff, Cardiff, by repeatedly stabbing him to neck, the head and the chest.",
        "text": "This is the moment the grandson of a multi-millionaire was arrested for the murder of his housemate and \"life-long\" friend after repeatedly stabbing him at the home they shared. The victim bled to death before his killer appeared expressionless and emotionless as he was arrested on suspicion of his murder.\n\nDylan Thomas, 24, the grandson of multi-millionaire and Peter's Pies owners Sir Stanley Thomas, had been \"life long friends\" with William Bush, 23, after they attended school together, but callously attacked him with knives at the home they shared in Llandaff, Cardiff, on December 24 last year. Mr Bush, who had been planning to move in with his girlfriend, suffered catastrophic injuries and died at the scene.\n\nA trial at Cardiff Crown Court heard Thomas surprised Mr Bush in his bedroom, having been driven to Cardiff by his grandmother Sharon Burton from her home in Rhoose that morning. During the night, Thomas had sent a number of messages to Mr Bush and had been searching the internet for veins and arteries in the neck.\n\nHe attacked his victim with a 7cm-long black flick knife and pursued his friend around the house as he fled for his life, stabbing him repeatedly in the back of the neck, the head and the chest. The pair went down two flights of stairs and outside onto a patio where Mr Bush finally collapsed after suffering a fatal cut to the artery in his neck, causing him to bleed to death.\n\nThomas had claimed he was suffering from an \"abnormality of mind\" due to suffering from psychosis and schizophrenia, and admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. But he was found guilty of murder by a jury on Thursday, and will be sentenced on December 16.\n\nIn footage released by South Wales Police, which was played at the defendant's trial, Thomas can be seen in a cage in the back of a police van as he is notified of Mr Bush's death and arrested on suspicion of his murder. In the footage, recorded by a body-worn camera, an officer can be heard saying: \"The time is 12.10pm, I'm now further arresting you on suspicion of murder. You remain under caution, you do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you may later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.\" When asked if he understood the caution, Thomas nodded and mumbled: \"Yes.\" \n\nThis interactive tool allows you to check the latest crime statistics for your area",

        "text": "A Nottinghamshire man responsible for building Putin-proof nuke bunkers has said worried Brits have flocked to get their own shelter amid the escalating situation in Ukraine.\n\nMatthew Wright had previously told the Star that his firm Burrowed had been inundated with requests since it was set up six months ago.

        "text": "Ukraine said Russia fired a new kind of missile at the city of Dnipro on Thursday and while there was debate over what kind, it appeared to be a nuclear-capable weapon that carried multiple warheads, in a further escalation of the 33-month-old war.\n\nKyiv said Russia used an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a weapon designed for long-distance nuclear strikes and never before used in war. Three US officials said it was an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a smaller range.\n\nIn Moscow, President Vladimir Putin said in a televised address that Russia launched a medium-range ballistic missile attack on a Ukrainian military facility in response to recent Ukrainian long-range strikes with Western weapons.\n\nRegardless of its classification, the latest strike highlighted rapidly rising tensions in the past several days.\n\nUkraine fired US and British missiles at targets inside Russia this week despite warnings by Moscow that it would see such action as a major escalation. Russia’s ambassador in London said on Thursday that Britain was now “directly involved” in the war in Ukraine.\n\nSecurity experts said that if the Dnipro strike involved an ICBM, it would be the first use of such a missile in war. ICBMs are strategic weapons designed to deliver nuclear warheads and are an important part of Russia’s nuclear deterrent.\n\nIntermediate-range ballistic missiles have a range of 3,000-5,500 kilometres.\n\n“Today there was a new Russian missile. All the characteristics speed, altitude are [of an] intercontinental ballistic [missile]. An expert [investigation] is currently underway,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video statement.\n\nUkraine’s foreign ministry urged the international community to react swiftly to the use of what it said was “the use by Russia of a new type of weaponry.”\n\nUkraine’s air force said the ICBM targeted Dnipro in central-eastern Ukraine and was fired from the Russian region of Astrakhan, more than 700km away. It did not specify what kind of warhead the missile had or what type of missile it was. There was no suggestion it was nuclear-armed.\n\n“Whether it was an ICBM or an IRBM, the range isn’t the important factor,” said Fabian Hoffmann, a doctoral research fellow at Oslo University who specialises in missile technology and nuclear strategy.\n\n“The fact that it carried a MIRV (Multiple Independently targetable Reentry Vehicle) payload is much more significant for signalling purposes and is the reason Russia opted for it. This payload is exclusively associated with nuclear-capable missiles.”\n\nRussia also fired a Kinzhal hypersonic missile and seven Kh-101 cruise missiles, six of which were shot down, the Ukrainian Air Force said, adding that the attack targeted enterprises and critical infrastructure in Dnipro, the air force said.\n\nDnipro was a missile-making centre in the Soviet era. Ukraine has expanded its military industry during the war but keeps its whereabouts secret.\n\nThe air force did not say what the ICBM targeted or whether it had caused any damage, but regional governor Serhiy Lysak said the missile attack damaged an industrial enterprise and set off fires in Dnipro. Two people were hurt.\n\nPrior to Putin’s comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters to contact the Russian military for comment when asked about the Ukrainian air force statement.\n\nUkrainska Pravda, a Kyiv-based media outlet, cited anonymous sources saying the missile was an RS-26 Rubezh, a solid-fuelled intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of 5,800km, according to the Arms Control Association.\n\nThe RS-26 was first successfully tested in 2012 and is estimated to be 12 metres long and weigh 36 tonnes, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). It said the RS-26 could carry an 800-kilogramme nuclear warhead.\n\nThe RS-26 is classified as an ICBM under a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russia, but it can be seen as an intermediate-range ballistic missile when used with heavier payloads at ranges below 5,500km, the CSIS said.\n\n‘Totally unprecedented’\n\nA group of glowing projectiles could be seen plummeting to the ground from the night sky in a video published by Come Back Alive, a Ukrainian military charity. It said the video was of Dnipro overnight.\n\nNato did not respond to a request for comment. The US European Command said it had nothing on the reported use of an ICBM and referred questions to the US Department of Defence.\n\n“If true this will be totally unprecedented and the first actual military use of ICBM. Not that it makes a lot of sense given their price and precision,” Andrey Baklitskiy of the UN Institute for Disarmament Research posted on X.\n\nGerman security expert Ulrich Kuehn posted: “It looks as if Russia has today used an ICBM in a war for the first time in history, against the civilian target Dnipro.”\n\nSome military experts said the ICBM launch, if confirmed, could be seen as an act of deterrence by Moscow following Kyiv’s strikes into Russia with Western weapons this week after restrictions on such strikes were lifted.\n\nRussian war correspondents on Telegram and an official speaking on condition of anonymity said Kyiv fired British Storm Shadow cruise missiles into Russia’s Kursk region bordering Ukraine on Wednesday.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry, in its daily report of events over the previous 24 hours on Thursday, said air defences had shot down two British Storm Shadow cruise missiles but did not say where. Britain had previously let Ukraine use Storm Shadows only within Ukrainian territory.\n\nUkraine also fired US ATACMS missiles into Russia on Tuesday after US President Joe Biden gave the all-clear to use such missiles in this way, two months before he leaves office and Donald Trump returns to the White House.\n\nPutin on Tuesday lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike in response to a broader range of conventional attacks.\n\nTrump has said he will end the war, without saying how, and has criticised billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine under Biden. The warring sides believe Trump is likely to push for peace talks — not known to have been held since the war’s earliest months — and are trying to attain strong positions before negotiations.\n\nMoscow has said the use of Western weapons to strike Russian territory far from the border would be a major escalation in the conflict. Kyiv says it needs the capability to defend itself by hitting Russian rear bases used to support Moscow’s February 2022 invasion.",

        "summary": "About two thousand people assembled for a second protest rally against the Nemunas Dawn party, whose leader is facing charges of anti-Semitism, being included in the government. ",
        "text": "About two thousand people assembled for a second protest rally against the Nemunas Dawn party, whose leader is facing charges of anti-Semitism, being included in the government. \r\n\nThe first protest, which was sparked by the Social Democrats inviting Remigijus Žemaitaitis’ party into the coalition, was held last Thursday in front of the parliament building.\n\n“I don’t have any hopes for big changes, but maybe the coalition agreement will change in one way or another, or the Social Democrats themselves will make appropriate decisions,” Aistė, a 35-year-old IT worker taking part in the rally, told BNS. “But I think it is more important to put pressure on the coalition to support and show opposition to this decision.”\n\nThe woman, who gave her first name only, said she came to protest because the ruling coalition with the Nemunas Dawn falls short of the “dignity principles” politicians should meet.\n\n“I think that in a democracy, it is important to show that we are dissatisfied, that some of us are dissatisfied, even those who voted for the people in power,” said the protester.\n\nKristijonas, a 23-year-old customer service agent, who also did not give his last name, told BNS that anti-Semitism in the ruling coalition was “very unsavoury”.\n\n“We may not achieve much, but it would have to be a long and continuous effort to get something more moving. Maybe not every week there should be protests, but every week there should be a conversation and not, as is the case with many things, we talk for two or three weeks and forget about it,” the man said.\n\nGintautas Paluckas, who was appointed prime minister on Thursday, promised to address the protesters and was present at the rally. He failed to meet the protesters last Thursday. \n\n“When it comes to democracy, we need to keep a few things in mind. In a democracy, every vote counts, but decisions are made by the majority, after hearing the opinions and positions of all,” Paluckas said.\n\n“Therefore, today, while respecting the arguments and the position you have set out, I would like to ask you not to lose hope. That the new coalition and the new government will be able to meet your concerns about state security, about national defence, about the provision of public services,” he continued.\n\nThe new ruling coalition is led by the Social Democrats and includes the Democratic Union “For Lithuania” and the Nemunas Dawn party.\n\nThe latter’s invitation to join the government has drawn criticism in Lithuania and abroad because Žemaitaitis is on trial for anti-Semitic posts on social media.\n\nEarlier this year, the Constitutional Court considered these posts and ruled that Žemaitaitis grossly violated the constitution. Žemaitaitis then resigned from the parliament in order to avoid being impeached.\n\nŽemaitaitis has rejected accusations of anti-Semitism, insisting that his social media posts were criticising Israel, not expressing hatred against the Jewish people.\n\nHe has insisted that his political opponents exploited his statements for political gain during this year’s campaigns.",

The Ukrainian Air Force released a similar message also asserting the unprecedented use of an ICBM.\n\n“Its speed and altitude suggest intercontinental ballistic capabilities. Investigations are ongoing. It’s clear that Putin is using Ukraine as a testing ground,” Zelensky said in his address.\n\nIf true, it would mark the first use of an intercontinental ballistic missile against an enemy in war. But there are some doubts about the accuracy of Ukraine’s reports.\n\nNeither the president nor the air force offered evidence or details on the model, target, or impact of the alleged ICBM, though outlets reported a damaging strike in the city of Dnipro that killed multiple people on the same day.\n\nSeveral U.S. officials have told outlets they do not believe the projectile was an ICBM.\n\nAn unidentified official told ABC News that it was a ballistic missile that struck Dnipro. Three separate U.S. officials, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Washington Post it was an intermediate-range ballistic missile, not an ICBM.\n\nThe Russian government seems to be playing into the confusion.\n\nMaria Zakharova, director at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs’s Department of Information and Press, took a phone call in front of the reporters in which she appeared to be told by an unknown superior not to comment on the ICBM reports.\n\n“About the ballistic missile strike on Yuzhmash that the Western media are talking about, we are not commenting at all,” the caller is allegedly heard telling Zakharova on a hot mic. “Yuzhmash” refers to a Ukrainian defense contractor known as Pivdenmash.\n\nMany observers questioned the strange circumstances of the phone call — an ostensibly secret conversation perfectly placed on a hot mic in front of dozens of journalists and widely shared by Russian sources after the fact.\n\nZakharova called allegations that the call was staged “false” via her Telegram channel, pointing out her regular use of smartphones during press conferences to communicate with other government offices.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on the reports, referring journalists to the Russian Ministry of Defense.",

One quarter has been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits, she added. \n\n TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X, and Instagram, among others, are the social media platforms that could face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars or 33 million US dollars for systemic breaches if young children are found with accounts on these social media.\n\nef/iff/jf/msm\n\nAUSTRALIA-POLÍTICA\n\nBuscan en Australia restringir acceso de menores a redes sociales\n\nCanberra, 21 nov (Prensa Latina) La ministra de Comunicaciones de Australia, Michelle Rowland, presentó hoy al Parlamento un proyecto de ley que prohibiría a los menores de 16 años del país usar las redes sociales.\n\nLa normativa, considerada una propuesta pionera en el mundo, tiene amplias probabilidades de convertirse en ley, pues se basa en la salud y la seguridad de las personas, con prioridad para la generación más joven.\n\nAl decir de la funcionaria, la seguridad en línea deviene uno de los mayores retos para los padres, por la cantidad de contenidos sin filtrar y los perjuicios que pudieran ocasionar, de acuerdo a numerosos estudios.\n\n Casi dos tercios de los australianos de 14 a 17 años han visto contenido extremadamente dañino en línea, incluyendo abuso de drogas, suicidio o autolesiones, así como material violento.

Both parties decided to drop the domestic violence restraining orders against each other in an effort to move on with their lives and effectively co-parent their son,\" Garcia's rep said in a statement shared with Us Weekly on Wednesday, November 20.The statement also thanked fans for their \"love and support\" for Garcia throughout this process, and asserted that the former Total Bellas star's \"number one priority has always been her son and privacy on the matter.\"On August 29, the former Dancing with the Stars pro was arrested and booked into the Napa County Jail on a felony domestic violence charge, with his bail set at $25,000, per online jail records. He was released on bail later that same day.Just under two weeks after the news went public, both Chigvintsev and Garcia, 41, filed for divorce. Garcia was seeking full custody of the couple's 4-year-old son Matteo, while Chigvintsev requested joint custody.On September 24, Napa County District Attorney Allison Haley revealed that they had chosen not to file criminal charges against Chigvintsev. \"While we take every arrest seriously and stand firmly against domestic violence, we have an ethical obligation to only file charges when supported by the evidence,\" the statement read.\"I am incredibly relieved and grateful that the domestic violence charges against me have been dropped. This has been an extremely difficult time for me. I am thankful that the truth has prevailed,\" the dancer shared in his Instagram Stories following the release of the DA's statement.On September 30, Garcia was granted a restraining order against Chigvintsev that prohibited him from coming within 100 yards of her or their son, with the exception being for visitation or exchange of the child per court-ordered visits, TMZ reported.On October 4, Chigvintsev was granted a restraining order against Garcia. His filing alleged that she was the aggressor, and contained photos of marks on his body that he claims were caused by Garcia. His filing also alleges that Garcia's claims were \"absolutely false\" and that she had lied to authorities in order to get him arrested.In November, Chigvintsev filed legal documents detailing the financial hardships he has allegedly faced following his arrest for domestic violence.\"After the mug shot and the arrest based on her false allegations, I was taken off the website faculty list resulting in loss of over $100k in income,\" he said in documents obtained by the Daily Mail.\"I also lost the social media promotion revenue,\" Chigvintsev said in the paperwork, in which he claimed that Garcia, \"continues to benefit from [the social revenue] as she was more worried about her career when she lied to the police, than mine.\"Garcia and Chigvintsev first met in 2017, when they were paired together on Dancing with the Stars — though the former WWE personality was engaged to John Cena at the time.Following her split from Cena, rumors swirled between her and Chigvintsev, but they didn't confirm they were dating until July 2019. They announced their engagement in January 2020, and welcomed their son Matteo in July of that year.The couple tied the knot on August 26, 2022, and their wedding was documented in a four-part special on E! called Nikki Bella Says I Do.",

The video was taken at Sophia Grace's baby shower for her second baby, for which she wore a pink dress — a nod to her having a baby girl and the cousin's pink tutus that they wore on the show.\n\n The cousins first rose to fame in 2011 when they were first invited onto The Ellen DeGeneres Show after a video of them dancing together went viral back. During the interview with DeGeneres, Sophia Grace — who was eight years old at the time — revealed that she and Rosie — who was five years old them — \"like dancing together.\"\n\n Sophia Grace added that \"Rosie makes me feel more confident\" when they would perform and they liked wearing \"pink fluffy dresses\" together. The pair — who were also massive Nicki Minaj fans — then gave the audience a \"show-stopping performance\" with Sophia Grace singing Minaj's 2011 hit while Rosie danced in the background.\n\n Their performance has garnered 49 million views on YouTube since it was posted back in 2011 and their recent recreation quickly went viral online, garnering over 34 million views on TikTok alone.

        "summary": "Donald Trump's re-election has reignited debates surrounding Israel's potential annexation of the West Bank, a controversial move backed by prominent members of Israel's far-right government.",
        "text": "The re-election of Donald Trump has reignited discussions over Israel’s potential annexation of the West Bank, a move supported by key figures in Israel’s far-right government. As speculation grows, many are questioning what such a step would mean for the region’s political and humanitarian future.Understanding the West BankThe West Bank, located west of the Jordan River, has long been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Originally part of the British Mandate of Palestine, the region became contested after Israel's creation in 1948. Following the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank, imposing a military administration while allowing settlements to expand.Also Read: Held back for a payday? After Jake Paul brags that he didn't go hard on Mike Tyson, Sylvester Stallone says the 58-year old boxer spared Paul's lifeToday, the territory is surrounded by Israel on three sides and borders Jordan to the east. It is home to millions of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation, with restrictions on movement and daily life.The region is also dotted with Israeli settlements, considered illegal under international law but defended by Israeli authorities as integral to their historical claims.Trump’s Role in Changing U.S. PolicyDuring his first term, Donald Trump dramatically shifted U.S. policy toward Israel. His administration moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing the city as Israel’s capital, and introduced a controversial peace plan that supported Israeli sovereignty over settlements in the West Bank. While not outright rejecting a two-state solution, Trump’s approach leaned heavily in favor of Israel.With Trump’s return to the White House, his administration appears poised to bolster Israel’s far-right agenda. Trump’s appointees, including Mike Huckabee as Ambassador to Israel, have expressed strong support for Israeli annexation, as mentioned in the report by CBS News.Huckabee has dismissed the concept of Palestinians as a distinct people and openly advocated recognizing the West Bank as part of Israel.Also Read: Donald Trump to replace defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth? His inner circle quietly preparing a list of alternativesIsraeli Leaders Push for AnnexationIsrael’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made annexation a key part of his coalition agreement with far-right parties like the Religious Zionist Party. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a vocal advocate of annexation, has expressed confidence that Trump’s administration will support their efforts.Smotrich recently reiterated that the West Bank is historically and indisputably part of Israel, framing annexation as a natural extension of Israeli sovereignty.Since October’s devastating Hamas attacks, critics argue that Israel’s government has used public grief to push forward its West Bank agenda, including expanding settlements and legalizing outposts.Implications of AnnexationIf Israel annexes the West Bank, it would mark a significant shift in the region’s geopolitics. Palestinians in annexed areas could either face exclusion from Israeli citizenship or become part of a unified Israeli state, further complicating efforts for a two-state solution.Analysts warn that annexation could cement Israel’s control over the territory, limiting future options for Palestinian statehood. Human rights groups, meanwhile, view the move as a form of de facto ethnic cleansing, erasing Palestinian claims to the land.Palestinian Resistance Remains FirmDespite the challenges, Palestinian leaders have vowed to continue their fight for independence. Mustafa Barghouti, a Gaza-based politician, stated that annexation would only strengthen their resolve. We will struggle for our rights. The alternative is extinction, he said.FAQs:Who controls the West Bank today?The Palestinian territories, which include the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem, have been under Israeli occupation since 1967.Who lives on the West Bank?The U.S. government estimates the Palestinian population to be approximately 3 million in the West Bank and 2 million in the Gaza Strip as of mid-2022. The majority of Palestinian residents in these territories are Sunni Muslims, with smaller communities of Shia and Ahmadi Muslims.",

        "text": "Timothée Chalamet's performance as Bob Dylan is being praised in early reactions to the upcoming movie A Complete Unknown.\n\n After Searchlight Pictures screened its new Dylan-focused biopic for the first time on Wednesday, Nov. 20, journalists and critics took to social media to offer largely positive reactions to 28-year-old Chalamet's portrayal of the iconic folk-rocker.\n\n \"Timothée Chalamet delivers the performance of the year in A Complete Unknown,\" journalist Scott Menzel wrote on X, where he also commended Monica Barbaro and Edward Norton's supporting performances as Joan Baez and Pete Seeger. \"A true tour-de-force where Chalamet is never seen. Chalamet’s performance is not just about the voice and look but rather all of the little nuances and mannerisms that he perfectly brings to his life in his portrayal of Bob Dylan.\" \n\n Variety editor Jazz Tangcay simply wrote, \"Wow,\" to summarize the movie in a post shared to X. \"Timothée Chalamet’s performance in this is superior. James Mangold and his entire team pull off a technical feat from sound, editing, costume, cinematography to production design, down to the subtleties of makeup and hair,\" Tangcay added. \"Loved it.\"\n\n Rotten Tomatoes critic Tessa Smith wrote that A Complete Unknown \"is absolutely incredible\" in a reaction shared on X. \"Clocks in at nearly 2.5 hrs but flies by,\" she added. \"The musical performances are perfectly placed, the story is captivating. Timothée Chalamet, Monica Barbaro, Elle Fanning, and Edward Norton all deliver unforgettable performances. I'm in awe.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n Variety's senior award editor Clayton Davis wrote that Chalamet \"slides into Bob Dylan with an effortless yet focused determination\" in the film. \n\n \"Fearless in some hypnotic moments. For me, it's Monica Barbaro and Elle Fanning that anchor the story of an illusive, mysterious man that remains in that sphere,\" he wrote. \"James Mangold helms with confidence, with gorgeous sets and costumes. Much respect to one of the best to do it.\"\n\n Critic Abe Friedtanzer wrote that while A Complete Unknown \"looks and sounds great,\" the movie is \"a standard biopic that truly comes alive when its iconic characters make passionate music together. Timothée Chalamet is well-cast but Monica Barbaro and Edward Norton steal the show as Joan Baez and Pete Seeger.\"\n\n Film critic Ryan Swen offered a differing opinion than many on X, where he described the movie as \"not terrible but often unsuccessful.\" \"Chalamet does his best, considerably better in the 1961 section than 1965,\" he added. \"Frequently incoherent/inaccurate.\"\n\n In addition to Chalamet, Barbaro, Fanning and Norton, the movie's cast also features Boyd Holbrook, Dan Fogler, Norbert Leo Butz, Eriko Hatsune, Big Bill Morgenfield, Scoot McNairy and Will Harrison.

        "text": "Double Olympic triathlon champion Alistair Brownlee has announced his retirement.\n\nThe 36-year-old became the first triathlete to successfully defend his Olympic title when he won gold in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, four years after triumphing on home soil in London.\n\n“It’s time to close this chapter… This marks my transition from professional triathlon, a moment approached with both dread and excitement in equal measure,” Brownlee, whose first significant title came in winning the 2006 Junior European Duathlon, wrote on social media .\n\n“Triathlon has profoundly shaped my life; I have dedicated nearly half of it to being a professional athlete, fulfilling my childhood dream and achieving far more than I ever dared to imagine.\n\n“Why now? It feels right. I am happy and content, eager for what lies ahead. I find myself smiling because it happened, rather than crying because it’s over (to paraphrase Dr. Seuss).”\n\nBrownlee was also individual World Triathlon champion twice, won the European title four times and competed alongside his brother Jonny, two years his junior, at elite level.\n\nJonny also won medals in London and Rio, and was famously helped across the line by his brother at the World Triathlon Series Final in Mexico in 2016 after nearly collapsing a few hundred metres from the finish.\n\nBrownlee is now considering what his next steps are away from the sport.\n\n“I look forward to embracing a slightly slower pace of life, yet not too slow,” the Yorkshireman added.\n\n“There’s an exciting array of events, challenges, and adventures awaiting me — things I’ve always wanted to have a crack at but haven’t had the chance to pursue.\n\n“For me, sport has always been a personal journey of exploration, and I’m excited to try some new challenges. Feel free to make suggestions below.\n\n“First, I have many wonderful people to thank and some well-deserved relaxation to embrace.\n\n“In the coming months, I’ll share more about my career and the incredible individuals who have been part of my journey, along with the new and exciting challenges and projects I’m eager to tackle.\n\n“I am deeply grateful to each and every one of you for your contributions, no matter how small you may believe they are.\n\n“Your support means the world to me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”\n\nBrownlee announced his potential by finishing 12th at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 aged 20 and by the following year was the best triathlete in the world.\n\nHe maintained his dominance for most of the next decade but increasingly struggled with injuries and illness during the latter stage of his career and missed out on selection for the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nBrownlee then switched his focus to long-distance events, with his final race coming at the T100 Triathlon World Championship Final in Dubai last Sunday, where he finished third.\n\n“I was pretty confident all year that this was going to be my last year racing, but I wanted to get to the end of the year and really see how I felt without making a rash decision,” he said.\n\n“It has got more difficult for me. I can’t do anywhere near the training that I used to be able to do. So I also found it hard at times being on the start-line, knowing that I’m not prepared to the level that I’d like to be.\n\n“I’ve been planning for this day for a long time. I’ve always had a pathological fear of having nothing to do and I didn’t want to wake up the morning after my last race and I’ve nothing to do apart from go to the pub. That would be a disaster.\n\n“So I’ve got all kinds of things and projects that I’m really looking forward to, excited to do and stay active, stay involved in sport.”\n\nThe brothers set up the Brownlee Foundation 10 years ago to help children get involved in sport, while Alistair is also a member of the International Olympic Committee Athletes’ Commission.",

        "summary": "Serbia’s president has warned NATO not to escalate with Moscow \nRead Full Article at RT.com",
        "text": "Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has warned that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin is serious when he speaks about using nuclear weapons if Moscow’s red lines continue to be crossed. He added that only “crazy people” or those unfamiliar with Putin would dismiss his warnings.\n\n“If you think you can attack everything on Russian territory with Western logistics and weapons without getting a response, and that Putin won’t use whatever weapons he deems necessary, then you either don’t know him or you’re abnormal,” Vucic told reporters on Monday, according to the Serbian news outlet Novosti.\n\nVucic, who has worked closely with Moscow over the years, cautioned that the planet is on the brink of catastrophe, as no one seems willing to negotiate a truce in the Ukraine conflict. “The world is approaching disaster. No one listens. No one talks about peace,” he said. “Today, it’s an intercontinental missile [sic]; tomorrow, it’s something else.”\n\nThe Serbian president, whose country was the subject of an extensive NATO bombing campaign in 1999, referred to Russia’s updated nuclear doctrine, which was approved by Putin on November 19. The document allows Moscow to treat an attack by a non-nuclear state, backed by a nuclear power, as equivalent to direct nuclear aggression.\n\nIt also broadens the scope for deploying nuclear weapons to include conventional military threats to Russia or its ally Belarus that could jeopardize their sovereignty or territorial integrity.\n\nVucic noted that Putin views nuclear weapons as a last resort, but stressed that if Russia’s security is under direct threat, the president will act. “If Moscow’s security or its forces are at risk, and if there’s no other way out, he will use nuclear weapons,” he said, adding that Serbia would avoid entanglement in such a conflict but warned that “the targets will be around us.”\n\nMoscow has consistently accused Western nations of escalating the Ukraine conflict by supplying Kiev with long-range missiles. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov recently called such actions a “new escalation” aimed at prolonging the war and using Ukraine as a proxy in a broader conflict with Russia.",

        "summary": "Hannah Kobayashi, 30, vanished during a layover on a flight from Maui to New York. She was seen in multiple locations over the next several days, with her family recently shown new surveillance footage.",
        "text": "The family of a missing Hawaii woman who vanished in Los Angeles earlier this month is sounding the alarm after seeing her in new surveillance video prior to her disappearance.\n\nHannah Kobayashi, 30, vanished during a layover on a flight from Maui to New York November 8. She missed her connecting flight in Los Angeles, cops said, before later being spotted 20 miles from the airport. \n\nShe was seen in multiple locations over the next several days, with her family recently shown a clip of her in Downtown LA on November 11.\n\nThe footage shows her with an unidentified individual, said her aunt Larie Pidgeon, who spoke with several publications on Wednesday, noting that the video shows the two getting off a subway at a station near the Crypto.com Arena. \n\nThat was around 10pm, and she has not been heard from since. \n\nThe new footage 'has made us extremely worried,' Pidgeon told The New York Post. Pidgeon cryptically told KHON Honolulu: 'She's not alone.' \n\nThe family hopes the clip leads to cops doing more to find Kobayashi, after they already flagged unusual speech patterns in her final text messages to them. Her sister, Sydni Kobayashi, said police are 'not taking [the case]... seriously.' \n\nPidgeon told People on Wednesday that the family is doing its own investigation, despite being 'terrified' by the the new clip. \n\n'We're really afraid,' she said.\n\nScroll down for video: \n\nWho is Hannah Kobayashi and where was she going?\n\nKobayashi is a resident of Haiku in Maui, and a photographer and artist. \n\nShe had been on her way to New York to photograph a DJ when she vanished.\n\nNow serving as the family's spokesperson, Pidgeon told People how her niece had made a meticulous, hour-by-hour schedule for the trip, which she described as a dream job. \n\n'She was so excited,' her aunt told the magazine.\n\nKobayashi made her November 8 flight from Maui to LAX, with a planned a 35-minute layover.\n\nDue to the tight timeframe, she missed her connecting flight to New York's JFK airport, police said. Pidgeon said that Kobayashi called from LAX to explain that she missed the flight.\n\nTrying to rebook, she told Pidgeon's sister, New York resident Geordan Montalvo, that she'd 'meet [her]' in the Big Apple.\n\nShe never made it, and afterwards sent family members a series of strange text messages they believe were not written by her.\n\nWhat are the details surrounding her disappearance?\n\nIn a statement sent out on Sunday, the family - 13 of whom have traveled to LA to look for Kobayashi - offered new details about the case.\n\nThey had acquired a clip showing the missing woman in the vicinity of the Pico Metro Station in Downtown LA. \n\n'In the footage, it is evident that Hannah does not appear to be in good condition, and she is not alone,' a statement read.\n\nIt went on to urge the many members of the public assisting in the search to focus on the Pico station area. The family plans to hold a rally there before the Los Angeles Lakers game Thursday to garner more support as cops continue their search. \n\nThey also instructed onlookers to remain vigilant when using the metro in LA.\n\nTwo days before she was spotted at the station, Kobayashi went to a bookstore at a local mall around noon, where she charged her phone and signed up for the store's book club. \n\nThat same evening, she returned to LAX, relatives said, describing how she again called Montalvo to tell her she was still trying to get to New York. \n\n'She was like, \"This is a nightmare. I don't understand what's going on with these airlines, I'm trying to get to you,'\" Pidgeon said.\n\nPolice confirmed that Kobayashi was spotted at LAX and a local Lebron James event the following day, Pidgeon said.\n\nWhat did Hannah Kobayashi's final text messages say?\n\nA missing-persons report was filed on November 10, amid what the family described as uncharacteristic correspondence from Kobayashi. \n\nOne of the messages reportedly said: 'Deep Hackers wiped my identity, stole all of my funds, & have had me on a mind f**k since Friday.'\n\nAnother claimed: 'I got tricked pretty much into giving away all my funds.' A follow-up added: 'For someone I thought I loved.'\n\nThe messages were sent on November 10 and early on November 11.\n\nIn a missing-persons poster sent out immediately after, police wrote: 'Prior to going missing, [Kobayashi] sent a message on November 10, mentioning feeling scared, and that someone might be trying to steal her money and identity. \n\n'She hasn't been hard from since.' \n\nHer sister, Sydni, has since revealed Kobayashi sent Venmo payments to two people who neither she nor the rest of the family recognized. Kobayashi's mother, Brandi Yee, also reported sending her a text message asking if she made it to New York. \n\nShe responded simply: 'Not yet.' Another early-morning text mentioned how she was in the midst of a 'spiritual awakening.'\n\nWhat does the new surveillance video show?\n\nThe new footage has sparked a new sense of urgency for Kobayashi's relatives.\n\nAside from it showing Kobayashi with an unidentified person near the Pico Metro station the day after she went quiet, it has caused 'major alarm and kind of solidified the family's suspicion that something has been awry,' Pidgeon told the New York Post. \n\n'It has made us extremely worried,' she added, saying she could not provide more information due to the ongoing investigation.\n\nHannah's sister Sydni gave statements to CNN this week saying that she believes the texts sent from her sister's phone hours before Kobayashi was spotted near the arena on November 11 were not from her.\n\n'She doesn't use the word ''hun,''' she said, citing syntax seen in one of the messages.\n\n'''Love'' and ''babe,'' but never ''hun.'' Even her close friends have said the same.' \n\nThe family hopes the new footage leads to some progress in the case.\n\n'The family is kind of doing their own investigation on the ground,' Pidgeon told the Post, adding that it was done to 'put a little bit more pressure on (LAPD) to do as much as the family's doing.'\n\nWas Hannah Kobayashi abducted?\n\nAs of Thursday, the LAPD has yet to declare that Kobayashi has been abducted.\n\nThe investigation is still being treated as a missing-persons case, a spokesperson confirmed. But in an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Pidgeon described that the family's mindset has shifted\n\n'Our mind is now going to, you know, abduction and, I hate to say the word, but, you know, trafficked,' she said. \n\n'We're doing the best that we can, but the family at this point is having to come to the reality that those things could be a possibility.'\n\nThe LAPD, meanwhile, is still spearheading the probe, but is now being aided by the FBI, field office agents in the city told KHON Honolulu Wednesday.\n\nStatements given to the station by Pidgeon appeared to indicate Kobayashi is still with the person in the footage, whom has yet to be physically described.\n\n 'She's not alone, she's with an unidentified person,' said Pidgeon. 'And she also got off and at a, at a station that is,' she continued, before trailing off. \n\n'It's not good and it terrified us, it brought her father to tears,' she concluded.\n\nPidgeon and others in LA will hold a rally to pass out fliers before the Lakers game Thursday afternoon, just a block from the station where Hannah was last seen. \n\n'It's all we can do,' Pidgeon said of the planned event.\n\n'We want to get as many people in one location that she was last seen and that Lakers game is huge for us.\n\n'We're even trying to get it on the Jumbotron. You know, we're trying. We're trying. We're trying.'\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to both Pidgeon and Syndi for more information.",

        "summary": "Over 59,000 displaced people in Manipur face a second winter in relief camps, frustrated by slow progress in resettlement efforts. While the government claims to have built and approved thousands of homes, many remain unoccupied due to security concerns and inadequate support for rebuilding.",
        "text": "Frustration reigns high in the over 302 relief camps of Manipur which have been giving a temporary abode to over 59,414 people who were displaced from their homes after ethnic violence erupted last year. This will be the second winter that the inmates will continue in these relief camps.In October, Chief Minister N Biren Singh said around 700 permanent houses have been built for displaced persons, and another 7,000 homes to provide temporary accommodation for those in relief camps have been approved by the Centre. But the situation on the ground is different. Officials said that in some houses, people have gone. One issue which inmates have voiced is that they will return only after proper security arrangements are made. Around 2,370 temporary prefabricated houses had been constructed, 200 in progress and 430 yet to be started, the CM said.People, who have been cooped up in these shelters, have been venting their frustration periodically. On August 1, police had fired tear gas shells, rubber bullets and baton-charged hundreds of internally-displaced people who held rallies demanding their return home in the border town of Moreh. Four people were injured. These protesters were sheltered in Imphal's Akampat. The protestors had claimed that they were living in a relief camp in harsh conditions and wanted the government to ensure security and funds to rebuild their homes and return.A senior official in the Manipur government told ET, The number of Meiteis staying in relief camps is around 25,000-30,000, rest might be Kuki-Zo people. However, it is hard to give any specific numbers . The CM had said in the assembly recently that 18,371 families were affected in the violence and around 14,857 families were residing in relief camps. There were 18,843 males in the relief camps and 21,245 females. There are 12,977 male children and 13,763 female children. The government of India has released ₹225.25 crore for the Internally displaced people (IDPs). Singh said the number of houses set on fire was around 11,133; houses destroyed were 4,569 and land of 5,554 farmers was affected.PROVISIONS TOO LITTLEThe CM stated that one-time financial assistance of ₹1,000 for those living in relief camps had been released four times. Students of relief camps had been linked to nearby schools and colleges. TV sets had been provided at relief camps to provide offline classes to students. Complementary nutrition and personal hygiene support items have been provided. Facilities for reconstruction of documents like aadhaar card, ration card, bank passbook etc have been made. Agricultural crop compensation of ₹18.91 crore was released for 3,483 affected farmers for equivalent crop loss. Under the Permanent Housing Scheme, ₹21.68 crore has been released for 798 beneficiaries for construction of permanent houses, ₹25,000 (25% advance) per affected family whose house had been burnt/damaged was released to 2792 families as interim relief.The chief minister said, the ministry of urban development has sanctioned 7,000 houses for displaced persons. Another proposal for 2,000 houses is in the process. We had a talk with the Union Home ministry for additional funds so that those residing in schools and colleges can go back to their homes. The central government has facilitated evacuation of 20,000 students and others in distress to safer places and camps by airlifting some of them. The situation after fresh violence erupted is under control but the situation remains tense. Helicopters and drones have been deployed to help security forces in monitoring the situation and in evacuations, explained an official.Over 10,000 Kuki-Zo people had taken shelter in neighbouring Mizoram, with at least 2,000 of them having come back to Manipur.",

        "title": "10 Wizard of Oz-Adjacent Movies and TV Shows That Aren’t Wicked",
        "summary": "The new Ariana Grande-Cynthia Erivo musical is just the latest project to travel the Yellow Brick Road.",
        "text": "Ding-dong, the Wicked movie is nearly in theaters—85 years after the original Wizard of Oz. If you want to dive into the emerald-hued source, you can stream the 1939 classic on Max. But if you’re seeking a horse of a different (yet still oddly familiar) color, consider these 10 Oz riffs.\n\nOz the Great and Powerful\n\nIn 2013, Disney made this lavish but uneven trip over the rainbow, with Sam Raimi helming a fantasy origin story for the eventual Wizard of Oz. He’s a sleazy con man when a tornado whisks him from Kansas, but with a lot of help he inches toward becoming the doddering “humbug” we know him to be. If you can get past James Franco being front and center, the rest of the cast is top-tier, with Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, and Michelle Williams playing versions of the Wicked Witches of the East and West, and Glinda. Also, there’s a Bruce Campbell cameo.\n\nReturn to Oz\n\nAcclaimed editor and sound designer Walter Murch made a rare visit to the director’s chair for this 1985 Wizard of Oz sequel, featuring Fairuza Balk (in her film debut) as Dorothy Gale and an aesthetic that perfectly marries whimsy with deeply surreal nightmares. As one of the most traumatizing films ever to be ostensibly aimed at children, Return to Oz has rightfully claimed its spot in the cult-movie pantheon.\n\nWhat, you thought Wicked was the first Wizard of Oz musical to conquer Broadway and then hit the big screen? The superstar team-up of Diana Ross (as Dorothy) and Michael Jackson (as the Scarecrow) top-lined the cast of this 1978 release, which has arguably better song-and-dance numbers than the original Oz. Its popularity has endured; most recently, a 2015 performance (the superstar team-up in this version: Mary J. Blige as the Wicked Witch of the West; Queen Latifah as the Wiz) aired on NBC as part of network TV’s brief but prolific phase of live musical broadcasts.\n\nTin Man was a three-part mini-series released in 2007 on what was then known as the Sci-Fi Channel. It proved to be an Emmy-winning hit for the network despite diverging wildly from the basics of The Wizard of Oz (io9 described its take as “kinky-gothy“). 500 Days of Summer-era Zooey Deschanel stars as “DG,” a Kansas waitress who gets tangled up in fantastical sci-fi adventures in O.Z., short for “the Outer Zone,” which is populated with characters that kinda, sorta echo back to the classic story.\n\nEmerald City\n\nThis TV series ran for just one season in 2017 on NBC. Emerald City had visually innovative director Tarsem Singh (The Fall, The Cell) behind the camera and starred a pre-Andor Adria Arjona as Kansas nurse Dorothy Gale, who’s picked up by a tornado and transplanted you-know-where. This version of the story is styled like a dark fairy tale, complete with a prophecy, and has some intriguing cast members beyond Arjona, including Daredevil‘s Vincent D’Onofrio as the Wizard.\n\nThe Muppets’ Wizard of Oz\n\nReleased in 2005 through ABC’s The Wonderful World of Disney—Disney had acquired the Muppets just a year prior—The Muppets’ Wizard of Oz is often forgotten in the Muppet filmography because unfortunately, it’s not nearly as magical as you’d want it to be. That’s saying something because this version features Kermit the Frog as the Scarecrow, Gonzo as the Tin Man, Queen Latifah (a repeat Oz-adjacent cast member!) as Auntie Em, and Miss Piggy as all of the witches.\n\nUnder the Rainbow\n\nThis gleefully tasteless 1981 comedy starring Chevy Chase and Carrie Fisher takes place in 1938, and was filmed at the actual Culver City hotel used for lodging the little people who played Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz. The plot involves hijinks (Secret agents! Nazi spies! Assassins!) and mix-ups galore, as well as a chase across the set of Gone With the Wind. Its setting around the fringes of The Wizard of Oz is an intriguing idea, but its depiction of little people has unfortunately not aged well—and frankly probably looked pretty insensitive even 40 years ago, considering the movie was nominated for a pair of Razzies. (Naturally, it now has a cult following.)\n\nWild at Heart and Lynch/Oz\n\nDavid Lynch’s obsession with The Wizard of Oz shapes the narrative and visuals of his 1990 crime-drama romance Wild at Heart, starring Laura Dern and Nicolas Cage as lovers on the run from her Wicked Witch-esque mother (played by Dern’s real-life mother, Diane Ladd). But it’s not just Wild at Heart that reflects his fascination with the Victor Fleming classic. As Alexandre O. Philippe’s 2022 documentary Lynch/Oz explores, Hollywood’s ruby-red cinematic touchstone has consistently inspired Lynch throughout his long, inventive career, often in less-than-obvious ways.\n\nCursed Films: The Wizard of Oz\n\nIf you want to hear all the sordid legends and rumors about the making of The Wizard of Oz gathered in one place (was there really an on-set suicide captured on film?), head to Shudder for the first episode of the second season of Cursed Films.

        "summary": "Fears are rising Vladimir Putin could launch deadly chemical weapons on his enemies as the war with Ukraine continues to unravel as UK-supplied weapons were used",
        "text": "Vladimir Putin is feared to be preparing to launch chemical weapons on his enemies as the situation continues to unravel. \n\n Reports in Ukraine suggested the country fired UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles at a Russian presidential facility with an “underground control room” in Kursk region - where Kim Jong Un’s commanders were holed up alongside Russian top brass. Today, it was reported the Kremlin’s desperate attempts to take back the region could lead to him reaching for his supply of chemical weapons. \n\n Ex-Nato commander Hamish de Bretton-Gordon warned: “Putin is absolutely rattled. He could have lost up to 700,000 soldiers already. Now, with Ukraine hitting back using US ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles, he knows his forces in Kursk are sitting ducks.”\n\nThe Russian despot today launched a revenge attack on Ukraine after the country hit a Russian site using British-made missiles. Ukrainian authorities said this morning the Russian military launched an attack on Dnipro using multiple types of missiles, including an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), reportedly the first used on the battleground.\n\n It comes as Moscow's ambassador claimed Britain is now \"directly involved\" in the Ukraine war, after its Storm Shadow missile was used inside Russia. Andrei Kelin told Sky News : \"Britain and UK is now directly involved in this war, because this firing cannot happen without NATO staff, British staff as well. I can say easily that we have plenty of mercenaries from different countries that are fighting right now on the side of Ukraine.\" \n\n The news comes amid heightened tensions as Kremlin sources also briefed of the possibility of an attack on a US airbase in Poland – an act of aggression that would almost certainly trigger a wider confrontation between NATO countries and Putin's war machine. While the range of an ICBM would seem excessive for use against Ukraine, such missiles are designed to carry nuclear warheads, and the use of one would serve as a chilling reminder of Russia’s nuclear capability and a powerful message of potential escalation. \n\n The attack comes two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine to formally lower the threshold for the country’s use of nuclear weapons. Putin has previously warned the U.S. and other NATO allies allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons to hit Russian territory would mean Russia and NATO are at war.",

        "title": "‘Simpler building process and more transparency from bill’",
        "summary": "THE Local Government Bill will streamline the building process, improve transparency and give local governments the power to raise revenue, said Minister of Works and Family Island Affairs Clay Sweeting.",
        "text": "By Fay Simmons\n\nTribune Business Reporter\n\nTHE Local Government Bill will streamline the building process, improve transparency and give local governments the power to raise revenue, said Minister of Works and Family Island Affairs Clay Sweeting.\n\nDuring his contribution in Parliament yesterday, Mr Sweeting said the bill will “empower” districts by giving them more autonomy and structure.\n\nHe said the bill clearly outlines the structure of the department and expands statutory responsibilities in building control, town planning, road traffic, hotel licensing and port matters so Family Island representatives can have a greater say in the structure of their communities.\n\n“Since 1996, the department has faced challenges which have arisen as a result of statutory functions not being clearly defined or being of subsequent changes to legislation, this, in some cases, would have recentralised statutory responsibilities, ultimately causing some statutory boards to become barely functional,” said Mr Sweeting.\n\n“This bill looks to reinstate and, in some cases, expand specified statutory responsibilities, particularly with respect to building control, town planning, road traffic, hotel licensing and port matters, because reality is people in the Family Islands want to be in control of their destiny. They want to have a say on what happens in their communities, and over time, central government has removed that from them, but this bill will allow the people in their communities who understand what they want it to look like what they need, will not have the imposition of New Providence imposed on what they need in their communities.”\n\nHe said the bill will streamline the building process by raising the local limit for approval of applications for single story dwellings from 2500 square feet to 3000 square feet before needing approval from New Providence.\n\nMr Sweeting said this move will not only make the building application process more efficient but also encourage economic development on the Family Islands.\n\nHe said the changes ould eliminate the need for any structure up to 3000 square feet to require New Providence Ministry of Works approval.\n\nHe said Family Islanders have for years “particularly complained about the lengthy process for building permit application and approval” He said the threshold for projects to be approved locally will be increased, adding: “Not only will this help to streamline the process, this will also help to increase economic development, because when you remove bureaucracy of Family Island residents, it allows them to move and develop their communities much quicker”.\n\nHe said the bill will also provide “greater transparency and accountability” by ensuring all contracts follow a procurement process as outlined in the Procurement Act and clearly outlines requirements for budgeting, fund allocations and audits.\n\n“The bill outlines precise requirements of budgeting, fund allocation and audits, and these stipulations support clear financial accountability on all levels. The Bahamian people have a right to know how their money is being spent, because the funding that is sent to local government is the people’s money,” said Mr Sweeting.\n\n“They need to be in a position to touch and to feel the financial investment in their communities. This bill seeks to outline a proper procurement process and provide a level playing field for persons wishing to offer their services through contractual works. There will be checks and balances to ensure that local communities receive value for money through projects undertaken by their district councils and town committees.\n\n“It falls in line with the current Procurement Act or ensure that they are fair and equitable distribution of contracts in the Family Islands as well. The bill also ensures collective responsibility with respect to financial matters, fiscal matters, it clearly addresses conflicts of interest, which again encourages transparency.”\n\nHe said the bill will also give local governments the legal authority to raise revenue and noted they are currently not even allowed to charge a clean-up fee to those who have events on public parks in Family Islands.\n\nMr Sweeting said the ability to raise revenue will allow local governments to impose these fees and supplement their subventions and highlighted that the budgets for local governments were increased by 10 percent under this administration.\n\n“This new bill gives councils revenue raising powers, which is a significant shift from relying solely from central government. This authority is most crucial as it enables districts to generate revenue locally, thus being able to supplement their current subventions from the government,” said Mr Sweeting.\n\n“Might I add that this administration, PLP administration, for the first time in decades, increased local government council’s budget by 10 percent and this was accomplished with councils all across the country. This will make provision also for additional project funding, which will be tailored to community needs and will support the development of new programs help improve infrastructure and enhance local services.”",

        "summary": "The Bahamas Chamber of Commerce and Employers’ Confederation told Tribune Business they strongly oppose “even the suggestion of increased taxation” after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) proposed a VAT increase among other changes to aid the government in reaching its 2031 debt target.",
        "text": "By Annelia Nixon\n\nTribune Business Reporter\n\nThe Bahamas Chamber of Commerce and Employers’ Confederation told Tribune Business they strongly oppose “even the suggestion of increased taxation” after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) proposed a VAT increase among other changes to aid the government in reaching its 2031 debt target.\n\n“As the voice of the business community, we take exception with several of the IMF’s suggestions that would adversely impact our members. Additionally, the ambiguity of some of these recommendations leaves room for unsubstantiated speculation and conclusions that may not align with the original intent. BCCEC vehemently opposes even the suggestion of increased taxation, especially on the backs of a business community that already must contend with increases in NIB, energy costs, minimum wage, cost of procurement from suppliers, shipping costs and customs duties among other inherent challenges like theft, wastage and spoilage. Surely, given the expertise within the government’s caucus, they can devise more ingenuity for increased revenue without the incumbrance of increased taxation, especially given revenue projections for 2024/2025 of more than $3bn compounding the record revenue with consistent failure to deliver basic services.”\n\nThe IMF report suggested that both VAT and Water & Sewage Corporation tariffs be increased because “further revenue reforms” would be needed. The BCCEC, however, proposed “streamlining government spending” instead, adding that customers barely receive the quality of service they are paying for and deserve as it is.\n\n“The report suggested recommendations to increase VAT and water costs. Increase to what percentage? What is the rationale? What feasibility study was conducted to determine that this was the best course of action? When is this proposed increase intended to be introduced and is the recommendation for a phased approach or immediate implementation? We already have the challenge of water quality, pressure and consistent supply, especially in neighbouring islands, so we question the audacity of the suggestion to increase cost with no mention of increasing the consistency of supply and service received. Instead, we recommend streamlining government spending to control expenses, which would have the same or better effect on revenue as the proposed increase taxation, without an added burden to taxpayers and businesses.”\n\nA 15 percent corporate income tax was recommended to be applied to large domestic firms, replacing business licence fees to which the BCCEC questioned and rejected.\n\n“Many businesses operating in The Bahamas are exempted from a fee for the issuance and/or renewal of their business licence and those that pay a fee are already subjected to the added cost of audited financials coupled with the inconvenience of the VAT offsetting practice being discontinued without prior consultation and impact assessment – a decision the BCCEC strongly opposed. Instead, we recommend continued enforcement for delinquent Real Property Tax as hundreds of thousands in collectable revenue is missed given our inefficiency of current tax measures making it inadvisable to enact new ones. With the ongoing impediments to the ease of doing business, the ever-increasing cost of doing business and lack of fiscal controls, the BCCEC [strongly] rejects this recommendation as well.”\n\nHowever, the BCCEC did agree and welcome some of the IMF’s recommendations.\n\n“The report references the domestic minimum top-up tax of 15 percent, which is a measure of fiscal equitability that the BCCEC has already provided its support for. Moreover, the publishing of beneficial ownership information of public contract awardees and audited financials for public corporations would increase fiscal transparency, so we also support this recommendation. Further, the incentivization of private sector investments, particularly outside of New Providence, would indeed expand MSME growth, arrest family island brain drains and improve crime mitigation factors, which the BCCEC has continually lobbied for over the years. Finally, the report highlighted the ease and cost of doing business. Specific reference is made to ‘expensive electricity, a shortage of skilled labour, and obstacles to business formation and expansion [weighing] on growth’. We wholeheartedly agree and call on the government to curate an environment conducive for the business community to first survive and then thrive with fiscal measures, policies and concessions designed to bolster longevity. We also call on the business community to take initiative and foster a culture of resilient ingenuity in the face of adversity, despite the regulatory challenges imposed by regulators.”",

        "summary": "Vladimir Putin also warned that the missiles could be used against countries that have allowed Ukraine to use their missiles to strike Russia.",
        "text": "Russia tested a new intermediate-range missile on Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has confirmed.\n\nThe Russian president said they were in retaliation to Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with US and British missiles earlier this week.\n\nPutin also announced that Russia would issue warnings in advance if such missiles were used again against Ukraine to allow civilians to safely evacuate.\n\nHe warned that US air defence systems would not be capable of intercepting the missiles.\n\nPutin made the comments during a nationwide TV address on Thursday.\n\nPutin’s announcement came hours after Ukraine claimed Russia had used intercontinental ballistic missiles for the first time in the conflict.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said it shot down six ICBMs out of a total of nine fired from Russia’s Astrakhan region towards the city of Dnipro.\n\nTwo people were wounded as a result of the attack, and an industrial facility and a rehabilitation center for people with disabilities were damaged, according to local officials.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a missile used “matches the speed and altitude” of an ICBM. The Kremlin refused to comment on the strike.\n\nZelenskyy said: “Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is. And how afraid he is.”\n\nICBMs are long-range missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, with a range of over 5,500 kilometres (3,400 miles).\n\nEarlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine which lowered the threshold over which the country could fire nuclear weapons.\n\nPutin’s new doctrine allows for a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer’s spokesperson did not confirm what kind of missile was fired, but said the launch of an ICBM amounted to “grave, reckless and escalatory behavior”.\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey said Thursday that the recent developments mark a “serious moment” in the war.\n\nWatch as Defence Secretary John Healey tells parliament’s defence committee\n\nHealey added: “Defence intelligence will reveal today that the frontline is now less stable than at any time since the early days of the full scale Russian invasion in February 2022.”\n\nHe added a clear escalation from Putin has taken place in recent weeks, including more attacks on Ukraine’s energy system and civilians, and the deployment of North Korean troops.\n\nAsked whether British storm shadow long range missiles had been launched into Russia, he said he “won’t be drawn on the operational details” of the conflict.\n\nCommenting in the House of Lords, former UK national security adviser Lord Ricketts told Parliament that permitting Ukraine’s use of long-range missiles would complicate Russia’s military advances but will not change the course of the conflict.\n\nOn Thursday, he said: “However much we all in this House want the Ukrainians to come out with a clear victory from this terrible war, the hard fact is that even with continued wholehearted western support they don’t have the combat power necessary to drive the Russians off every metre of Ukrainian territory.”\n\nThursday’s reported ICBM attack on Ukraine follows a Kremlin promise of retaliation, after Ukraine launched American and British long-range missiles into Russian territory for the first time on Tuesday.\n\nUkraine’s strike resulted from a week of US foreign policy shifts and firsts, which saw President Joe Biden permit the country to fire the weapons at Russia and anti-personnel mines sent to Ukraine.",

        "summary": "The UK Government confirmed that Russia had, for the first time, used a ballistic missile with a range of ‘several thousand’ kilometres.",
        "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to strike the UK with a new ballistic missile after using the weapon to hit a target in Ukraine.\n\nDowning Street condemned Mr Putin for further escalating the conflict by using a ballistic missile with a range of “several thousand kilometres” against the city of Dnipro.\n\nMr Putin suggested the missile could be used to hit Kyiv’s allies who have given Ukraine permission to use Western-supplied weapons to hit targets within Russia.\n\nThe UK is believed to have allowed its Storm Shadow missiles to be used by Ukrainian forces within the Kursk region of Russia, while the US has given permission for its ATACMS weapons to be fired at targets in Mr Putin’s country.\n\nMr Putin confirmed Russia has tested a new intermediate-range weapon, saying it came in response to Ukrainian strikes on the Russian territory with US and British missiles earlier this week.\n\nThe Russian leader declared that Russia would issue advance warnings before strikes on other countries to allow civilians to evacuate to safety.\n\n“In response to the use of American and British long-range weapons on November 21 of this year, the Russian armed forces launched a combined strike on one of the facilities of the Ukrainian defence industry,” Mr Putin said in a televised address.\n\n“One of the newest Russian medium-range missile systems was tested in combat conditions, in this case, with a ballistic missile in a non-nuclear hypersonic warhead.”\n\nHe added: “We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against military facilities of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against our facilities.”\n\nIn Westminster, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “My understanding is that it is the first time that Russia has used a ballistic missile in Ukraine with a range of several thousand kilometres.”\n\nNo 10 said it was “an example of escalatory behaviour from Russia”.\n\nBut the Prime Minister’s spokesman added it “only serves to strengthen our resolve and to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to act in self-defence against Russia’s reckless and illegal invasion”.\n\nThe missile’s range far outstrips that of newly authorised US and British supplied weapons.\n\nThe distance from Moscow to London is around 2,500km, suggesting the range of the new missile could threaten the UK.\n\nRussia’s military claims it has shot down two British-made Storm Shadow missiles, following reports that debris from the weapons had been discovered in the country’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have launched an incursion.\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey earlier revealed to a committee of MPs that the UK knew Russia had been “preparing for months” to fire a new ballistic missile.\n\nMr Healey warned Ukraine faces a “serious moment” in its defence against Mr Putin’s invasion, but refused to confirm that Kyiv had been given permission to use Storm Shadow in Russia.\n\nDowning Street and the Ministry of Defence have repeatedly declined to comment publicly on the use of Storm Shadow.\n\n“It risks both operational security and in the end the only one that benefits from such a public debate is President Putin,” the Defence Secretary told MPs.\n\nBattle lines in Ukraine are now “less stable than at any time since the early days of the full-scale Russian invasion”, Mr Healey said, citing British intelligence.\n\nSpeaking at the same time, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the House of Commons the UK “will not be deterred or distracted by reckless threats” from Mr Putin, who has lowered the threshold for using his nuclear arsenal.\n\nSir Keir also insisted that all the UK’s support for Kyiv was “in accordance with international law” and “always for self-defence”.",

        "text": "Predicting T arrival times has gotten a little easier with Wednesday’s launch of “MBTA Go,” the agency’s new mobile app.\n\nThe app offers “real-time information in the palm of your hand,” General Manager Phil Eng told the MBTA Board of Directors Thursday. \n\n“What the riders will see — and we’re going to continue to build this out as we get more feedback — but … now you can use this app to find out where the trains are, you can see them in the system, you can also see if there’s any issues,” Eng said. “If we have a planned outage and we have shuttle buses, that will be shown on this. And this will show all the modes.”\n\nCurrently available to iPhone users, the MBTA Go app offers real-time rider updates like estimated arrival times and train or bus tracking, the MBTA said in a press release. The T plans to release a version for Android users in February. \n\nAccessible in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Portuguese, Haitian Creole, and Vietnamese, the app also offers an interactive map so riders can see which services and transfers are available at each T stop. More than 4,000 riders have piloted the MBTA Go app since July, the T said. \n\n“We want riders — whether it’s their first time in Boston, or longtime residents — to feel comfortable using public transportation, and this app will be a great tool to accompany people through their trips and to keep them up to date as they navigate the system,” Eng said in a written statement. \n\nTransportation Secretary Monica Tibbits-Nutt said the app will encourage more trips on public transportation as riders feel empowered with knowledge about the T.\n\n“Putting this app into the hands of many of our riders will make their trips so much more efficient as they will be able to make decisions in the moment about how soon to go to a station stop, what MBTA vehicle to choose for a trip, and how long they’ll need to wait,” Tibbits-Nutt said in a statement.",

        "summary": "South Andros business owners and residents have become frustrated with the pace of road repairs and have renewed calls for roadwork to be completed.",
        "text": "By Fay Simmons\n\nTribune Business Reporter\n\nSouth Andros business owners and residents have become frustrated with the pace of road repairs and have renewed calls for roadwork to be completed.\n\nJulian Gibson, owner/operator of Eula Nixon Convenience Store and Last Stop gas station, told Tribune Business that after residents were promised roadworks would be completed with the signing of a new contract, only a portion was completed before work came to an abrupt stop.\n\nHe said after residents protested, the road leading from the dock was paved but residents still have to combat massive potholes that damage their vehicles in areas that are still untouched.\n\n“Right after that, they paved the road leading to the dock. All the residents of South Andrews were happy. It’s a start, but it stopped. It stopped right there, and today, it has yet to continue,” said Mr Gibson.\n\nMr Gibson said residents along with the town council undertook the task of patching potholes throughout the community yesterday and said the Davis administration and the former Minnis administration both “dropped the ball” on their road repairs.\n\n“I applaud and I salute the young men of South Andros who stepped up to the plate and patched some of these potholes. That’s what we need as a community, stepping together, not depending on government, because this government and the former government don’t care about South Andros. That’s how it looks when it comes to the road construction,” said Mr Gibson.\n\nLeon Lundy, Member of Parliament for South and Central Andros, said the roadwork has commenced and is going well.\n\nHe said contractors started off at the dock but they will eventually move to pave the remainder of the constituency.\n\n“The roadwork is going well, it already commenced. They started off with the dock area, that should be finished by the first part of December. They already also surveying and plotting out the roadways to continue moving along. As soon as they finish the dock, they’ll start on the main road,” said Mr Lundy.\n\n“The majority people live in the north and the central part. So that that’s why they strategically doing it. But all of the roadwork will get done.”\n\nHe said the Water and Sewerage Corporation will begin trenching next week to install water lines and the roadwork in those areas could not be undertaken until the water work is complete.\n\n“There’s some water work that’s already signed off on that’s about to begin next week, and it has to do with some trenching, because they’re going to run piping.\n\n“So there’s no way they could come and start paving in the centre part of the island, because that’s where the majority of that water work is in order to alleviate some of that water problems that we’re having down in South Andros right now.”\n\nHe said the road patching being done on the island was undertaken by the local council and the Ministry of Works.\n\nPastor Joshua Rolle, a member of the local council, said the condition of the roads has become a vexing issue for residents who frequently have to repair their vehicles after falling into potholes and the council decided to fill up the holes to prevent further damages.\n\nHe said many businesses have also complained of dust entering their establishments due to the unpaved portion of road.\n\n“For a couple months now they were supposed to do the road and they didn’t finish it. They didn’t start really, they did the dock. And now we have plenty holes in the road and its costing the residents plenty money replacing CV joints, shocks and bearings,” said Mr Rolle.\n\n“So I decided to go and just try to fill up some of them holes. Tomorrow, we’ll try to put some curry in the hole, because it really damaging these vehicles.”\n\nHe said local councillors and residents of the Kemps Bay area came together to fill up the potholes in hope of easing some of their burdens but urged the government to ensure the contractors carry out their duties.",

        "summary": "The girl’s murderer sat through a polygraph test after her death and passed",
        "text": "California officials say they have identified the man they say is responsible for brutally raping and murdering a teenager in 1979.\n\nIn February of that year, Esther Gonzalez, 17, was attacked while walking from her parents’ house to her sister’s home in Riverside County, about 55 miles east of Los Angeles. \n\nThe next day, the teenager’s body was found dumped in a snowpack near a highway. Authorities at the time determined she had been raped and bludgeoned to death.\n\nThe case went cold for more than 45 years until officials were able to use forensic technology to find her killer. In a news release issued on Wednesday, the Riverside County District Attorney said that a man named Lewis Randolph “Randy” Williamson is now tied to the case. \n\nWilliamson died in 2014. He served in the US Marine Corps and moved to Florida, according to the Los Angeles Times. He had a history of assault allegations but had no convictions for violent crimes, the outlet reported.\n\nFollowing Esther’s murder, Williamson called the Riverside County Sheriff’s Station to report finding a dead body. He told police he didn’t know if the person was male or female. Officials noted the man was “argumentative.” Once investigators were able to identify the caller, they brought him in for a polygraph test five days later.\n\nWilliamson agreed and passed the test, effectively clearing him of wrongdoing. A semen sample was recovered from Gonzalez’s body but DNA testing wasn’t available at the time. The sample was eventually uploaded to the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), a national DNA database widely used by law enforcement officials. \n\nDetectives continued to investigate the case for years. \n\nIn 2023, members of the county’s homicide cold case team sent various items to a lab in Texas for testing. Officials were later able to use a sample of Williamson’s blood from an autopsy to determine his DNA matched the DNA found on Gonzalez, bringing closure to the girl’s family. \n\nJason Corey, a county investigator, told the newspaper: “This killing still haunts them,” speaking of Gonzalez’s family.” But Esther was never forgotten by us all these years.”\n\nAuthorities are asking that anyone with information on the case or potential victims contact county officials.",

        "summary": "Amidst the ongoing 'New York Times' lawsuit against OpenAI, important data providing potential evidence of copyright infringement was accidentally deleted by the AI company.",
        "text": "OpenAI may have accidentally deleted important data related to its ongoing copyright lawsuit brought by the New York Times. First reported by TechCrunch, counsel for the Times and its co-plaintiff Daily News sent a letter to the judge overseeing the case, detailing how \"an entire week’s worth of its experts' and lawyers' work\" was \"irretrievably lost.\" OpenAI had provided the plaintiffs with two dedicated virtual machines for researching alleged instances of copyright infringement. According to the letter, on Nov. 14, \"programs and search result data stored on one of the dedicated virtual machines was erased by OpenAI engineers.\" \n\n OpenAI says over 2 million people consulted ChatGPT for the 2024 election\n\nThe Times has accused OpenAI, and Microsoft which uses OpenAI's models for its Bing AI chatbot, of copyright infringement by training its models on paywalled and unauthorized content. The lawsuit detailed multiple instances of \"near-verbatim\" copy in ChatGPT responses. OpenAI has refuted this claim, saying their models were trained on publicly available data, and therefore fair use under copyright laws. The case hinges on the Times being able to prove that OpenAI's models copied and used its content without compensation or credit. OpenAI was able to recover most of the erased data, but the \"folder structure and file names\" of the work was unrecoverable, rendering the data unusable. Now, the plaintiffs' counsel must start their evidence gathering from scratch. In the letter, counsel affirmed that there's \"no reason to believe [the erasure] was intentional,\" but also pointed out how \"OpenAI is in the best position to search its own datasets.\" The AI company has avoided sharing any detail about its training data. Other similar copyright claims have been filed against OpenAI. But a lawsuit from Raw Story and AlterNet was recently dismissed because the plaintiffs could not prove enough harm to support their claims. Meanwhile, OpenAI has struck licensing deals with several media companies, to use their work for training and providing ChatGPT responses with citations. Recently, Adweek reported that OpenAI is paying publishing giant Dotdash Meredith at least $16 million a year to license its content.",

        "text": "About 167,000 pounds of both fresh and frozen ground beef products have been recalled over possible E. coli contamination, according to the the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). After the Minnesota Departments of Agriculture and Health noticed a link between a group of reported illnesses and ground beef from Wolverine Packing Co., a meat distributor based in Detroit, Michigan, the FSIS said they worked with the Minnesota Departments to investigate. Fifteen people were reported sick as of Nov. 20, with symptoms beginning between Nov. 2 and Nov. 10. That same day, the FSIS said in a press release, the Minnesota Department tested a ground beef sample from Wolverine Packing Co. and found that it contained a strain of harmful bacteria called E. coli O157:H7. The FSIS provided a list of all affected products and images of every product label that is part of the recall. The fresh products have a “use by” date of Nov. 14, and the frozen ones have a “use by” date of Oct. 22, they said. The recalled products list the number “EST. 2574B” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These products were shipped to restaurants across the country, causing the FSIS to be “concerned that some product may be in restaurant refrigerators or freezers.” They're urging restaurants “not to serve these products,” and encouraging consumers to “safely prepare their raw meat products,” advising them to cook all beef products to 160 degrees Fahrenheit to properly kill bacteria. E. coli O157:H7 is the same strain of bacteria linked to onions in some McDonald’s Quarter Pounders in October. It can cause intestinal bleeding, bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can damage blood vessels in the kidneys, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",

He was profoundly gifted and clearly loved by his teammates. As you can imagine, Kaiden’s family, coaches, and teammates are heartbroken and need our prayers,” Smith’s message continued.\n\n In a statement to PEOPLE, Associate Vice President for University Communications Kathy Dean said, \"Like all of our athletes, Kaiden recently passed a battery of health screenings, including heart and lung evaluations. None of these tests indicated health concerns. Kaiden was found unresponsive shortly after he finished his weekly skills workout with UM coaching staff and trainers. Out of respect for the family, we have no plans to comment further at this time.\"\n\n The Fort Lauderdale resident was described lovingly by Archey, who said, “Kaiden was just scratching the surface on the court but his smile and positive energy could be felt from day 1.”\n\n “He will be truly missed and I can’t thank him enough for being a part of my life over the past few months. My heart aches for his family, friends and teammates,” Archey added.\n\n Classes were canceled on Wednesday, Nov. 20, “to give our community time to mourn and pray,” according to the university, but a “campus-wide” vigil was still held on-site Wednesday morning.",

The companies involved are from the beauty, construction, pharmaceutical, healthcare, information technology (IT) and franchise industries.\n\nThe US companies involved in The Bahamas visit include Global Care International; Viridbio Solutions; Palladio Beauty; John P Hair Care; GlobalKlass Groupe; Bison Coolers; Steak and Shake. “We are here to partner and collaborate with universities, hospitals and businesses to provide customised healthcare solutions and trainings,” said Dr Vishal Soni, principal for New Jersey-based Viridbio Solutions.\n\n“The Global Diversity Export Initiative trade mission has given me an excellent opportunity.

        "text": "By Annelia Nixon\n\nTribune Business Reporter\n\nThe Bahamas Chamber of Commerce & Employers’ Confederation is concerned with the rise of crime and its impact on businesses, especially following an IDB report stating the country’s GDP experienced a loss of $100m with 40 percent of that owed to crime.\n\nThe chamber also cited a recent robbery on Sunday, saying: “The Bahamas Chamber of Commerce & Employers’ Confederation has noted the increased scourge of crime befallen the business community, with the latest four-man armed robbery on Sunday, leaving the owner and employees shaken. We renew our call for the government to increase police presence, especially with the onset of the busy holiday season to keep residents, tourists, business establishments and patrons safe.\n\n“This brazen robbery only solidifies the IDB’s report which highlights the impact of crime on the GDP, noting that 40 percent of the $100m loss was directly attributable to businesses spending on security to combat the effects of crime. Moreover, it validates the BCCEC’s continuous call for the increased ease and decreased cost of doing business in The Bahamas as our members already have to contend with several competing factors that erodes their bottom-line and a myriad of challenges including crime. These added costs are passed onto the consumer and undoubtedly fuels the inflation and economic fallout we are experiencing today.\n\nThe BCCEC said it’s their hope that “the introduction of new police officers earlier this month” can be stationed “in crime-ridden, high-traffic areas or used to relieve officers in other departments that can now be shifted to the front line given their experience and expertise”.\n\n“As before, the BCCEC again welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with the government by providing business mapping for heavily saturated areas and filtering the direct concerns from our members/the business community relative to lighting, patrols, vagrants, blind spots and other aspects that can impede the safety of the shopping public. We will not rest until this matter is addressed with the urgency it requires.”\n\nSuggestions for the business community provided by the BCCEC include only having a minimal amount of cash on your business’ premises during work hours, securing money in a safe or lock box instead if in a register “in the sight of customers.” They also recommended “monitored controlled access” and a height marker to a business’ entrance door as well as “a measure of forceful difficulty to enter/exit” They recommend vigilance and a well lit area especially “if you are opened beyond dusk and always open/close with an accompanying member to avoid being caught alone in extenuating circumstances.” They also proposed that businesses “invest in contents insurance, a security guard, camera and alarm system as soon as fiscally possible.”",

        "text": "Davina McCall can't explain her rosey outlook on life - admitting that the difficulties of her past may have pulled others down.\n\nThe 57-year-old TV icon has been through many testing times over her years - including an addiction to heroin and more recently going into surgery for an emergency operation on her brain. The My Mum, Your Dad host alarmed fans this month when she revealed she needed emergency treatment after doctors discovered a benign brain tumour.\n\nShe underwent surgery earlier this week and is said to be recovering well. Now a podcast episode has been released - recorded before her surgery - where she reflected on life's trials and her personal philosophy. Davina, who has been divorced and has been dating her boyfriend, Michael Douglas, since 2017, says she is \"annoyingly positive\".\n\nAdmitting she cannot understand why she has such a bright outlook, the star reasoned that it must simply be part of her in-built personality. She shared her thoughts while discussing life on her latest podcast, titled the Begin Again podcast.\n\nThe star mused: \"I have been through so many things and sometimes I have wondered why I am still such a positive person. I am actually aggravatingly and annoyingly positive. But I don't know if you can change things like that about yourself really.\"\n\nDavina has another podcast, called Making The Cut, in which she shared her fears about going under the knife and explained how her boyfriend, Michael Douglas, was supporting her. She revealed: \"All I know is that I've chosen an amazing surgeon, I have absolute faith in him. I'm going to give him the steering wheel and strap myself into the passenger seat and enjoy the ride. As they're putting me under - which is such a nice feeling by the way - I'm going to set an intention and I'm going to say, 'love, love, love, all the way'.\"\n\nShe also revealed she had been trying to \"ignore\" the surgery, and recalled the surprise she felt over her diagnosis, saying: \"I waltzed into this health check cocky. It's me, fitness lady, and I came out with a benign brain tumour. I slightly put my head in the sand because they said it's a colloid cyst and sometimes it grows and sometimes it doesn't and sometimes it just stays stable for years.\n\n\"So I thought well I don't need to do anything about it, they can just scan me again. Then somebody called me and said they'd like to make an appointment with a neurosurgeon and I was like, 'That doesn't sound good!' So I went to talk to this person and he showed me my brain which blew my mind, weirdest thing ever. He pointed it out to me, it's right in the middle of my brain.\"\n\nFollowing her surgery, Michael shared a post to update Davina's fans via her Instagram account. He wrote: \"Update folks. Thanks so much to all the well wishers. She really has made an enormous leap forward in the last 24 hours. She is out of ICU. She is “loving awareness”. Thank you xx Michael.\"\n\n Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.",

Soccer is becoming alarmingly close to overshadowing it as a more challenging sport!\n\nAnyway, here’s what’s happening in the NRL…the most rugged of sports.\n\nBig changes are anticipated for the Wests Tigers, as long-time players Bryce Gibbs and Liam Fulton are free to negotiate with other clubs, and veteran prop Todd Payten is rumored to be considering retirement.\n\nThe intriguing developments at Concord are at the forefront of an energetic recruitment phase that will potentially see Darius Boyd, Kade Snowden, and possibly Clint Newton don Newcastle Knights colors next season. Although Wests Tigers chief executive Stephen Humphreys has refrained from commenting, insiders at the club have verified that Gibbs and Fulton have been allowed to converse with rival clubs as the joint venture aims to secure emerging forwards Aaron Woods, Andrew Fifita, and Matt Groat.\n\nWith a year remaining on their contracts, both Gibbs and Fulton’s departures would create salary cap flexibility for the Tigers not only to maintain their emerging talents but also to finalize a contract with Melbourne Storm superstar Adam Blair. After struggling with injuries for the last 18 months, Payten is contemplating retiring a year earlier than planned. Gibbs and Fulton’s agent has reportedly initiated discussions with Cronulla, who are also engaging in early talks with Ben Ross as they prepare for life post-Snowden and Luke Douglas, who is heading to Gold Coast Titans.\n\nThe Sharks have made significant advances to acquire Woods, but Wests are nearing a deal to re-sign the 20-year-old local junior. They have also opted to extend Fifita’s contract for an additional year.\n\nHere’s the latest news from the clubs:\n\nNewcastle Knights \n\nSnowden’s signature is nearly a given, as the prop is eager to return home. The newly capped Kangaroos prop has spent two weekends in Newcastle recently, the latest visit occurring after last Friday’s Test. Surprisingly, negotiations are taking place to bring back beloved figures Clint Newton and Danny Buderus. Buderus’s return might complicate matters with current rake Isaac de Gois, who is considering a substantial offer to head back to Cronulla.\n\nGold Coast Titans\n\nOdds are high that Beau Champion will join Jamal Idris, Luke Douglas, and Aidan Sezer on the holiday strip in 2012, along with Roosters star Nate Myles. The Titans are also seeking a new hooker to succeed Warriors-bound Nathan Friend. Roosters utility Anthony Watts or Panthers rake Masada Iosefa might be potential candidates.\n\nFaced with a vacant front row for 2012, the Sharks are on the hunt for replacements in Gibbs, Ross, and also Trent Waterhouse, who will conclude his career at Penrith this season. Despite being under contract for another year with Parramatta, Justin Poore could also be in contention, as he’s a South Coast local who might welcome the opportunity.a shorter commute to Woolooware.\n\nThere’s a quiet confidence among officials that they can manage to outsmart Manly and secure the in-demand teen Will Hopoate, beating the Bulldogs to his signature. Additionally, there’s an effort underway to bring David Williams back home, as he is one of many Eels juniors currently playing elsewhere. Following the substantial investment made in Chris Sandow, coach Stephen Kearney is seeking further support for the scrumbase, with Ben Roberts firmly in consideration. The retirement of Paul Whatuira last week will assist their efforts.\n\nSouth Sydney\n\nWith the departure of Sandow shaking things up, Souths are now on the hunt for a new halves combination, as John Sutton is set to move back to the back-row under Michael Maguire for next year. Another player familiar with Maguire, Brett Finch, has informed friends that he will only return to the NRL if he is paired with an established half, and the out-of-favor Raiders’ Matt Orford has a close relationship with the former Wigan coach.\n\nThere are also reports that the Rabbitohs have inquired about James Maloney, but New Zealand will likely exercise their option to retain the playmaker in Auckland, given that Brett Seymour’s contract will end this year. Although Souths have faced criticism for re-signing Sutton, they managed to keep him at a low cost under the salary cap, thanks to the long-service player discount being applied.\n\nSydney Roosters\n\nThe feather duster is poised over Anthony Minichiello, Mark Riddell, Phil Graham, along with Myles and Watts. If they were to leave, it would pave the way for a last-minute attempt to acquire Blair, who has yet to formally sign with Wests, despite reports indicating that a deal is in place. Veteran prop Jason Ryles has a one-year option that will be activated based on a certain number of games played, but don’t expect coach Brian Smith to find himself in another Kirk Reynoldson standoff. He and Ryles share a close bond.\n\nby Buford Balony",

        "title": "'Our John Prescott always challenged Britain to be a better country'",
        "summary": "'It will be a tribute to his legacy when more and more people, whatever their start in life, can, as John did, realise their talents to the full,' writes former Labour PM Gordon Brown",
        "text": "John Lennon wrote a famous song about a working-class hero.\n\nJohn Prescott would never have used the words \"working-class hero\" about himself—he always underplayed his achievements—but knowing John, I don't think he would have complained if others used these words for him.\n\nThere are few who achieve something akin to heroic status in their own lifetime, particularly those who have to deal with the messy compromises of being in government.\n\nBut John Prescott became—and will remain—a Labour movement legend.\n\nHe started from humble beginnings, and after failing his 11 plus, he never got the bike he had been promised if he had passed the exam. He joked his first girlfriend rejected him because his spelling, revealed in a letter to her, was so bad. So, after leaving school at 15, he decided to educate himself.\n\nNot content with being a waiter and cabin steward on a Cunard liner, his quest for an education led him to sign up for correspondence courses and then college. He was never anything other than grateful for the opportunities he then enjoyed at Ruskin College Oxford and Hull University and devoted the rest of his life to getting these chances for others too.\n\nAnd this hero was always passionate in his beliefs in fairness for all, courageous in fighting for the causes he adopted, and despite an outwardly deceptive image of uncompromising toughness, he was very generous, believing in the good in everyone—even the egg thrower in Wales who John famously punched during a general election campaign, of course in self-defense.\n\nAfter his studies at Oxford and Hull, his rise was meteoric: union official, Labour MP, Labour frontbench spokesman on the regions, and then the positions of Deputy Labour Leader and Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nAnd his achievements in government should not be forgotten.\n\nWith Al Gore, he was the moving force behind the first agreement on climate change at Kyoto. Angry at areas left behind by coal, steel, textile, and port closures, John was the pioneer of modern regional policy, which paved the way for devolution and elected Mayors.\n\nWithout his determination as environment minister, 1.4 million homes would not have been improved—a record figure with half of all social housing modernized to the benefit of thousands of families who escaped damp, overcrowded, and insanitary conditions.\n\nFrom 1992, he was helping John Smith and Tony Blair reform the Labour Party to make it electable, and then the former boxer was key to holding the ring and keeping things together during difficult times such as over Iraq.\n\nJohn and his wife Pauline were always a glamorous couple; she and their sons were always devoted to supporting his work, and our thoughts at this time are with her and her sons and wider family.\n\nJohn’s courage saw him through difficult times. He was diagnosed with diabetes and then bulimia and was open and honest about the changes in diet and lifestyle he had to make to cope with the conditions, helping others to adapt along the way. Latterly, he had severe Alzheimer’s, a condition he wanted the country to take more seriously with better research and treatment. But through it all, John smiled and joked and was warm-hearted when talking to friends.\n\nBeing a working class hero was, as Lennon knew, a difficult thing to be. But our John Prescott coped - always fighting hard for the good things in life for everyone - not just himself. Lennon also knew that Britain has always been a country where there is so much potential but too little opportunity. But our John Prescott always challenged Britain to be a better country. And it will be a tribute to his legacy when more and more people, whatever their start in life, can, as John did, realise their talents to the full.",

        "summary": "The Charity Commission said the Ingram-Moores' misconduct and mismanagement of the charity 'was not an isolated incident but a repeated pattern of behaviour.'",
        "text": "Captain Sir Tom Moore’s daughter and son-in-law “repeatedly benefited” from the “mismanaged” charity set up in his name, making more than £1 million from their connection to the foundation, the Charity Commission has found.\n\nThe report, published on Thursday, was highly critical of the conduct and actions of the charity’s former trustee and CEO Hannah Ingram-Moore, the daughter of the World War II veteran, and her husband Colin Ingram-Moore, a former trustee.\n\nThe Charity Commission said that the couple’s “misconduct and/or mismanagement was not an isolated incident but a repeated pattern of behaviour.”\n\nHowever, the Charity Commission found that “to date the charity has not received any money from the first publishing agreement,” despite indications from Moore that he intended for his work to generate money for good causes.\n\nThe report referenced the prologue of Moore’s autobiography, “Tomorrow Will Be a Good Day,” which said “with the offer to write this memoir I have also been given the chance to raise even more money for the charitable foundation now established in my name.”\n\nThe Commission highlighted “disingenuous” statements from Hannah Ingram-Moore about not being offered a six-figure salary to become the charity’s CEO, despite setting out expectations for a £150,000 package when taking on the role.\n\nThe couple had also inappropriately used the foundation’s name in a planning application for a spa pool block on their land which implied it would be used by the charity. They did not inform or seek consent from the unconflicted trustees. The building was later demolished on order of the local authority.\n\nA spokesperson for The Captain Tom Foundation said they are “pleased with the Charity Commission’s unequivocal findings regarding the Ingram-Moores’ misconduct.”\n\nThey joined the watchdog in asking the couple “to rectify matters by returning the funds due to the foundation so that they can be donated to well-deserving charities as intended by the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.”\n\nHoldsworth said: “The public—and the law—rightly expect those involved in charities to make an unambiguous distinction between their personal interests, and those of the charity and the beneficiaries they are there to serve.\n\n“This did not happen in the case of The Captain Tom Foundation. We found repeated instances of a blurring of boundaries between private and charitable interests, with Mr. and Mrs. Ingram-Moore receiving significant personal benefit.”\n\nThey said the inquiry had impacted the family’s mental and physical health, “unfairly tarnishing our name and affecting our ability to carry on Captain Sir Tom’s legacy.”\n\n“A credible regulatory body would provide the full truth, rather than misrepresenting, and conflating facts and timelines that align with a predetermined agenda,” they said.\n\nHoldsworth defended the work and decision of the Commission, telling the PA news agency, “We are relentless as a regulator and, yes, we will follow wrongdoing where we find it in the sector.”\n\n“I think if you read the report, the public can draw their own conclusions about the total amount of private benefit the Ingram-Moores have achieved through their association with the charity,” he said.",

        "text": "ESPN makes decision on future of iconic NBA broadcaster Hubie Brown\n\nREAD MORE: LeBron James announces he is quitting social media in weird post \n\nBy JAKE FENNER\n\nPublished: 18:16 GMT, 21 November 2024 | Updated: 18:16 GMT, 21 November 2024\n\nESPN NBA commentator and former NBA head coach Hubie Brown will be calling his final game this season at the age of 91.\n\nIn an interview on the Sports Illustrated Media Podcast with Jimmy Traina, ESPN President Burke Magnus revealed that Brown would be stepping aside.\n\n'We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,' Magnus told the podcast. 'He deserves that. We think the world of him.\n\n'I think it is absolutely remarkable the level in which he still calls games at age 90-plus. I don't mean to be purposely mysterious here but we are going to honor Hubie during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style.'\n\nAccording to Richard Deitsch of The Athletic, Brown is not scheduled to call any games this season. But sources told the outlet that he will be assigned a final game at a date to-be-determined.\n\nIt's expected that Brown will be placed alongside ESPN play-by-play man Mike Breen for the game.\n\nBasketball legend Hubie Brown will be calling his final NBA game this season at age 91\n\nBrown (L) poses for a photo with Dave Pasch at an NBA game in Philadelphia in February 2024\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nNBA star Isaiah Thomas announces tragic death of his sister in heartbreaking post\n\nThis revelation comes just weeks after Hubie's son, Brendan Brown, unexpectedly passed away at the age of 54. \n\nBrown has one of the most legendary careers in the history of basketball. He was briefly a player in late 1950's before turning his attention to coaching.\n\nAfter coaching high school in the mid-50s and throughout the early to mid 60s, Brown served as an assistant at William & Mary before taking the same position at Duke before they were a fully-fledged national powerhouse.\n\nHe then left for the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks, where he was an assistant under Larry Costello and coached the likes of Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nThen he jumped to head coach with the American Basketball Association's Kentucky Colonels - where he won the ABA championship in 1975 over the Indiana Pacers with the likes of Dan Issel, Louie Dampier, and Artis Gilmore on the team.\n\nBut with the 1976 merger between the ABA and NBA, the Colonels owner agreed to fold the team in exchange for $3million in cash.\n\nBriefly out of a job, Brown then jumped to the Atlanta Hawks where he coached for five seasons. He put up a record of 199-208 and won NBA Coach of the Year in 1978 before he was fired with three games left in the 1980-81 season.\n\nBrown went the whole season without a coaching job, but began broadcasting NBA games with the USA Network and CBS.\n\nBrown, seen here as coach of the Atlanta Hawks, during a game against Boston in 1980\n\nBrown coaches the New York Knicks against the Washington Bullets in 1984\n\nBrown, seen here coaching one of his final games for Memphis on November 10, 2004\n\nLeBron James rips NBA rivals for passing on Lakers rookie after 37-point display: 'F***ed it up!'\n\nHe did that for one season before being hired as the head coach of the New York Knicks in 1982. The Knicks reached the playoffs in the first two seasons under Brown, but slipped in the 84-85 and 85-86 seasons.\n\nWhile that did lead to the Knicks drafting superstar Patrick Ewing in 1985, Brown did not last much longer at Madison Square Garden. He was fired just 16 games into the 1986-87 season and returned to broadcasting.\n\nBrown moved to calling games full-time with CBS until the network stopped covering the NBA following the 1990 NBA Finals. From there, he called local games with the Philadelphia 76ers and the Detroit Pistons before joining TNT in the early 1990s.\n\nHe continued with TNT until he was hired by the Memphis Grizzlies as their head coach in 2002 - 16 years after his last NBA coaching job. Across three seasons, Brown turned the team around from a 28-46 record in the 2002-03 season to a 50-32 record and a playoff appearance the following campaign in 03-04.\n\nBut questions about his health led the 71-year-old to resign on Thanksgiving Day of 2004, citing 'unexpected health-related issues... [that were] absolutely nonexistent at the beginning of the season.'\n\nBrown returned to broadcasting with ABC as their top NBA analyst, where he's been ever since - working with the likes of Al Michaels, Mike Breen, Mike Tirico, Mark Jones, and Dave Pasch.\n\nBrown was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005, the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, and the National Sports Media Association Hall of Fame in 2022. \n\nShare or comment on this article:\nESPN makes decision on future of iconic NBA broadcaster Hubie Brown\n\nAdd comment",

        "title": "Mac Miller Estate to Drop Unreleased 2014 Album ‘Balloonerism’",
        "summary": "\"Releasing Balloonerism was something that Malcolm frequently expressed being important to him,\" Miller's estate wrote",
        "text": "Mac Miller‘s family wants the late rapper’s favorite records to reach his fans. On Wednesday, Miller’s estate announced that it will officially release Balloonerism, a full-length album Miller made in 2014, on Jan. 17, 2025.\n\n “It is a project that was of great importance to Malcolm – to the extent that he commissioned artwork for it and discussions concerning when it should be released were had regularly,” read the estate’s statement, “though ultimately GO:OD AM and subsequent albums ended up taking precedence.”\n\n “We believe the project showcases both the breadth of his musical talents and fearlessness as an artist,” the estate continued. “Given that unofficial versions of the album have circulated online for years and that releasing Balloonerism was something that Malcolm frequently expressed being important to him, we felt it most appropriate to present an official version of the project to the world.”\n\n Miller worked on Balloonerism around the same time as Faces, the 2014 mixtape that many consider to be his best work. At the time, Miller released Faces as a free digital download, although his family dropped the project on streaming services and vinyl in 2021. Instead of going with Balloonerism, Miller dropped GO:OD AM, his first release while signed to Warner, in 2015.\n\n Miller’s estate first teased the Balloonerism drop during Tyler, the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw, when an animated trailer — featuring “The Song That Changed Everything” with SZA and “5 Dollar Pony Rides” — played on screens before Tyler took the stage for his headlining set.\n\n Miller’s estate shared the trailer on YouTube, which splices clips of a little boy and his sprawling imaginary life of human-like animals going on a journey through a carnival. “I’ve been runnin’, runnin’ runnin’/Running ’round,” he sings throughout the trailer. The video then jumps to the album cover as “5 Dollar Pony Rides” plays in the background.\n\n Miller’s website offers several versions of the project for presale, including a $150 deluxe edition with foil-wrapped slipcase, a 3D pop-up centerfold, a 32-page booklet of photos and lyrics, a poster, and a white splatter cloud vinyl. The site also lists a clear $40 vinyl, and a $15 CD.\n\n Since Miller died of an overdose in 2018, his family has slowly approved the release of several of Miller’s projects, starting with the 2019 song “Time” alongside Kali Uchis and Free Nationals. They followed that song’s drop with Circles, the album he was working on to accompany Swimming, in 2020. That same year, the estate made K.I.D.S available on streaming services for its 10th anniversary.",

        "text": "Ms Foley was speaking at an education debate held by the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) last night, when panellists were asked whether they would define the shortage of teachers as a ‘crisis’ and what their respective parties would do about it. \n\nMs Foley said she knows many principals who “dread” the phone call each Sunday night or Monday morning about requiring an additional substitute and outlined initiatives introduced during her term, including the reduction of the teacher-pupil ratio “which means we need more teachers” and more education training places.\n\nShe added: \"Just on that, the word ‘crisis’, when written in one particular language, means opportunity, or it means division, or disappointment. We see it as an opportunity to do more and more in this space.”\n\nSpeaking today, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald described the comment as “shocking”, adding: “Teachers are leaving this country in their droves, principals are in crisis mode every day trying to staff classrooms and Fianna Fáil think this is an opportunity.”\n\nShe said young teachers are “valued” and her party wishes to “move heaven and earth so that you can make your life here”.\n\nEducation Minister Norma Foley has been criticised for using the word “opportunity” when addressing the shortage of teachers in schools during a teachers’ union debate\n\nIn a statement today, Ms Foley said there has been “a lot of commentary\" about her comments in relation to teacher supply and further clarified her point made during the debate.\n\n“There has been a lot of commentary about my remarks on teacher supply during the INTO general election education debate,” she said.\n\n“What I was saying is that we have 9,000 extra teachers in schools, and we have to take every opportunity to introduce new measures such as: grants to support students doing a masters in education, grants to support STEM teachers, extension of substitution panels.\n\n“We have increased the number of student teaching places by 610 per year, so we now have over 3,800 new teachers graduating every year. With around 1,800 teachers retiring every year, that means we have a very strong pipeline of new teachers on the way.”\n\nSpeaking at the launch of Fianna Fáil’s policy plan for Dublin this morning, Finance Minister Jack Chambers said his party colleague Ms Foley was speaking in the context of creating “opportunity for young people by supporting increased numbers of teachers working in our schools”.\n\n\"We are absolutely clear on reducing the pupil-teacher ratio providing a much greater number of posts in schools across the country and also supporting increased numbers of public servants working, including teachers,” he said.\n\nMr Chambers said Fianna Fáil has provided a “significant provision in our overall fiscal framework for a public pay deal” and has “ambition” to lower the pupil-teacher ratio and increase recruitment.\n\n\"We want to support and work with teachers in Dublin and elsewhere to ensure that they have opportunities to work and live and that’s why the affordability measures which Darragh (O’Brien) has set out in this plan are very clear on supporting public servants and people who are at the heartbeat of public services in this country.”\n\nOn whether he would agree that the situation represents an “opportunity” rather than a crisis, Mr Chambers said: “What I would say is, we know there are challenges in certain schools in Dublin – which I have engaged with as a TD in Dublin – when it comes to recruitment and some of that relates to further work required on affordability when it comes to housing and Darragh (O’Brien) is working on that.”\n\nHe said the party also wants to support increased pay with a new public pay deal.\n\n\"That’s why as the party of education, we have real ambition in our manifesto to lower the pupil-teacher ratio, to recruit more teachers and really provide that opportunity for young people by supporting increased numbers of teachers working in our schools and I think that was the context in which Minister Foley set out – not dismissing challenges that are there, we listen to teachers, we listen to principals and that’s the context of her comments.”",

        "summary": "SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for his ambitious agenda to regulate Wall Street and the crypto industry, will step down on January 20th. During his tenure, Gensler oversaw new rules to boost transparency and reduce risks in financial markets, as well as enforcement actions against firms using unauthorized communication channels and cryptocurrency exchanges.",
        "text": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on Jan. 20 when President-elect Donald Trump's administration takes over, the agency said on Thursday, ending an ambitious tenure that saw him clash with Wall Street and the crypto industry. I thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility. The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favor, Gensler, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2021, said in a statement. Known for his hard-charging style, Gensler led an ambitious agenda to boost transparency, reduce systemic risks, and stamp out conflicts of interest on Wall Street, completing dozens of new rules, some of which have been challenged in court. Among his major accomplishments were changes to boost the resilience and efficiency of U.S. markets, including speeding up trade settlements and overhauling the $28 trillion Treasuries market, as well as a number of rules boosting investor disclosures and corporate governance. The Baltimore native also successfully implemented rules mandated by Congress imposing SEC oversight on auditors of U.S.-listed Chinese companies, ending a decade-long tussle with Beijing that lawmakers said had put U.S. investors at risk. On the enforcement front, Gensler's SEC broke new ground with a multi-year effort focused on Wall Street's use of text, WhatsApp and other unauthorized channels to discuss business, levying more than $2 billion in fines against dozens of firms, including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. He also took on the crypto industry, suing Coinbase , Kraken, Binance and others, alleging that their failure to register with the agency violated SEC rules, accusations the companies deny and are fighting in court. When it comes to crypto, the courts have mostly backed Gensler's positions. But his sweeping agenda and uncompromising posture sparked intense pushback from Wall Street, as well as congressional Republicans, and even some Democrats. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Managed Funds Association and other groups sued in the conservative-leaning Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and elsewhere to overturn at least eight rules, arguing they were unjustified, harmful or beyond the SEC's authority.",

        "summary": "It comes after Russian Foreign Ministry says a United States anti-missile base in Poland is now ‘a priority target’",
        "text": "Vlasimir Putin has claimed Moscow launched a new hypersonic ballistic missile against Ukraine in response for long-range strikes by Kyiv inside Russia using UK and US long-range missiles.\n\nThe Russian leader said the \"Oreshnik,\" or Hazel, medium-range missile had been used in some of its latest strikes. Earlier, Ukraine’s air force said Russia had fired a intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in an attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro - in what would be the first recorded use of the weapon during war\n\nUkrainian air defence forces said the missile - that has a range of more than 3,400 miles and can be used to carry nuclear warheads - was fired from Russia's Astrakhan region, on the Caspian Sea. However, American officials said an initial US assessment indicated the strike was carried out with an intermediate-range ballistic missile which cannot travel so far, something backed by Putin’s remarks.\n\n\"In combat conditions, a test was carried out of one of the latest Russian intermediate-range missile systems,” Putin said.\n\nThe incident comes amid fast-rising tensions between the West and Russia, after Ukraine fired both British Storm Shadow missiles and American ATACMS missiles into Russia being granted permission to do so this week.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky claimed the missile fired on Thursday used “matches the speed and altitude” of an ICBM, adding that Kyiv’s “crazy neighbour once again showed what he really is, and how afraid he is”.\n\nKyiv’s air force said the attack targeted enterprises and critical infrastructure, but has not specified which kind ofmissile was used.\n\nDowning Street condemned Putin for further escalating the conflict by using a ballistic missile against the city of Dnipro. Putin suggested the missile could be used to hit Kyiv's allies who have given Ukraine permission to use Western-supplied weapons to hit targets within Russia.\n\nPutin’s remarks came hours after Russia’s Foreign Ministry claimed that a new US ballistic missile defence base in northern Poland is \"a priority target for potential neutralisation.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: \"Given the nature and level of threats posed by such Western military facilities, the missile defense base in Poland has long been added to the list of priority targets for potential destruction, which, if necessary, can be executed with a wide range of advanced weapons\".\n\nThe US base at Redzikowo is part of a broader Nato missile shield, dubbed \"Aegis Ashore\", which the alliance says can intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles.\n\nPawel Wronski, Poland's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said there were no nuclear missiles at the base, which was purely for defence.\n\n\"It is a base that serves the purpose of defence, not attack,\" Mr Wronski said. \"Such threats will certainly serve as an argument to strengthen Poland's and Nato's air defences, and should also be considered by the United States.\"\n\nThe Nato missile shield includes sites in Poland, Romania as well as US Navy destroyers at a naval base in Spain and an early warning radar in Turkey, according to Nato.\n\nOn Wednesday, images circulated online appearing to show fragments of Storm Shadow missiles in Russia’s Kursk region – the border area into which Ukrainian forces staged a surprise assault in August. Around 50,000 Russian troops, including about 10,000 soldiers from North Korea have massed in Kursk to try and retake the swathe of territory currently held by Ukraine. The use of North Korean troops in Kursk is believced to have played into the decsion from the US and UK to allow Ukraine to fire long-range missiles into Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday, at a Commons Defence Committee meeting, UK defence secretary John Healey said he “won’t be drawn on the operational details of the conflict”.\n\nHe said MPs should “be in no doubt that the UK government is stepping up our support for Ukraine, determined to continue doubling down our support for Ukraine”.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Russia also struck Mr Zelensky's home city of Kryvyi Rih, wounding 26 people, said the head of regional administration, Serhii Lysak. The missile strike caused damage to an administrative building, at least five multi-story residential buildings, and civilian vehicles.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry, meanwhile, claimed in a statement that its air defense systems shot down two British-made Storm Shadow missiles, six HIMARS rockets, and 67 drones.\n\nThe statement didn't say when or where the Storm Shadows were shot down or what they were targeting. Russia earlier reported downing some of the missiles over the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula.\n\nAnalysts and observers say that the loosening of restrictions on Ukraine's use of Western missiles is unlikely to change the the course of the war, but it puts the Russian army in a more vulnerable position and complicates the logistics that are crucial in warfare.\n\n\"It is an important move and it pulls against, undermines the narrative that Putin had been trying to establish that it was fine for Russia to rain down Iranian drones and North Korean missiles on Ukraine but a reckless escalation for Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons at legitimate targets in Russia,\" said Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser who now sits in the House of Lords.\n\nReuters contributed to this report",

        "summary": "The International Criminal Court found ‘reasonable grounds to believe’ that Benjamin Netanyahu was responsible for war crimes in Gaza.",
        "text": "Sir Keir Starmer backed the International Criminal Court after it issued arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister and former defence minister over alleged war crimes in Gaza.\n\nDowning Street said the Government respected the independence of the ICC after the warrants were issued for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the court, based in The Hague, was “the primary international institution for investigating and prosecuting the most serious crimes of international concern”.\n\nA domestic court process would be required before Mr Netanyahu faced arrest if he set foot in the UK.\n\nThe ICC also issued a warrant for Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’ armed wing, over the October 7 2023 attacks that triggered Israel’s offensive in Gaza.\n\nIsrael is believed to have killed Deif in an airstrike, but Hamas has never confirmed his death.\n\nThe issuing of warrants for the Israeli prime minister and ex-defence minister along with a Hamas leader, led to critics claiming the court was drawing a moral equivalence between the government of a democracy and a group banned as a terrorist organisation in many countries, including the UK.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s spokesman said: “This Government has been clear that Israel has a right to defend itself in accordance with international law.\n\n“There is no moral equivalence between Israel, a democracy, and Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, which are terrorist organisations.\n\n“We remain focused on pushing for an immediate ceasefire to bring an end to the devastating violence in Gaza which is essential to protect civilians, ensure the release of hostages, and to increase humanitarian aid into Gaza.”\n\nAsked if Mr Netanyahu would be arrested if he came to the UK, the spokesman said: “We are not going to get into hypotheticals.”\n\nThe ICC said there were “reasonable grounds to believe” that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant were responsible for “the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts”.\n\nThe ICC pre-trial chamber also found “reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant each bear criminal responsibility as civilian superiors for the war crime of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population”.\n\nThe impact of the warrants is likely to be limited since Israel and its major ally, the United States, are not members of the ICC.\n\nMr Netanyahu said Israel “rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions” and “there is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza”.\n\nShadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said the warrants were “concerning and provocative”.\n\nShe criticised the ICC for drawing a “moral equivalence” between Israel’s actions in Gaza and the Hamas terrorist atrocity on October 7, 2023, which triggered the military response.\n\nShe said: “The Labour Government must condemn and challenge the ICC’s decision.”\n\nBefore the election in July, Tory ministers had been considering lodging a legal challenge to the issuing of arrest warrants, but the Labour administration dropped that idea, saying it was a matter for the court to rule on.\n\nLiberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Calum Miller said: “The previous Conservative government denigrated the International Criminal Court and undermined the UK’s standing on the world stage.\n\n“It is vital that the new Government complies with our obligations under international law by committing to upholding this ruling, including enforcing arrest warrant.”\n\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his Independent Alliance group of MPs wrote to Sir Keir urging him to confirm the UK would enforce the arrest warrants.\n\nSNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts and Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer also urged an end to UK arms sales to Israel.",

        "text": "The Mexican stock market showed signs of recovery on Thursday morning, breaking an eight-day losing streak. Investors kept a watchful eye on political developments in the United States as they navigated the market landscape.\n\nThe S&P/BMV IPC, Mexico’s main stock index, rose 0.11% to 50,225.21 points. This index tracks the performance of the most traded local stocks.\n\nSimilarly, the FTSE BIVA index of the Institutional Stock Exchange increased by 0.13% to 1,026.97 points. Most stocks within the benchmark index traded higher.\n\nGrupo Carso, owned by Carlos Slim, led the gains with a 1.57% increase to 117.40 pesos. Gruma followed with a 1.08% rise to 342.89 pesos, while PINFRA grew by 0.88% to 182.61 pesos.\n\nThe market’s upward movement came after a challenging period. The S&P/BMV IPC had fallen for eight consecutive sessions, accumulating a 4.14% loss.\n\nInvestors remained cautious as they awaited information about the policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the Mexican peso weakened against the U.S. dollar for the second day in a row.\n\nPeso Depreciates Amid Global Market Fluctuations\n\nThe exchange rate reached 20.3513 pesos per dollar, representing a depreciation of 2.90 cents or 0.14% from the previous day’s official rate of 20.3223.\n\nThe dollar’s value fluctuated between a high of 20.4070 and a low of 20.2619 pesos. The Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, dropped 0.04% to 106.64 points.\n\nGlobal markets remained focused on potential policies of the incoming U.S. administration and their possible impacts. Adding to the peso’s weakness was news of a Russian ballistic missile attack on Ukraine.\n\nEconomic data from the United States also influenced market sentiment. Weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fell, while a report on manufacturing activity came in below expectations.\n\nIn Mexico, retail sales data showed growth for the third consecutive month in September. Grupo Financiero Banorte noted a 0.1% increase compared to the previous month, according to figures released by INEGI.",

Trump has been vocal about his mistrust of health agencies. At a rally in Wisconsin, he said his administration would \"take on the corruption at the FDA, the CDC, World Health Organization and other institutions of public health,\" arguing they are dominated by \"corporate power\" and \"China.\" With controversial Cabinet picks like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Dr. Mehmet Oz as head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a lot can change for the country's public health systems.\n\nWhat did the commentators say?\nThe second Trump presidency is \"poised to have big impacts on consumer health care,\" said CNBC. Trump will likely face \"few legislative roadblocks\" as Republicans now have majorities in all branches of government. With this, Trump will \"have the power to influence America's healthcare landscape, including insurance coverage, drug price negotiations, government health and safety regulations and reproductive healthcare access,\" said Insider.\n\nHealth-related agencies are most likely to see a loss in capabilities, namely the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which came under fire following Covid-19. Under Trump, the agency would \"most likely lose the authority to enact the few actions it is empowered to use in public emergencies,\" said The New York Times. This includes \"pausing housing evictions, limiting the movements of cruise ships and requiring masks on public transportation.\" However, a \"complete restructuring of the CDC may not be realistic,\" because it would require congressional support including from moderate Republicans.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

The National Institute of Health (NIH) has been a \"frequent target of Trump and his Republican and other allies.\" While how restructuring would happen is unclear, \"proposals have included everything from shrinking the number of institutes by half to replacing a subset of the agency's staff members.\" Stifling medical research can have long-term consequences for disease prevention.\n\nTrump's second term could change insurance coverage and abortion access. The president-elect has had a \"mixed record\" on these issues, said Insider. Despite this, the Trump administration and Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint, have plans to \"try to roll back the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which broadened the pool of people who qualify for coverage.\" This could be done by capping funding or adding work requirements for Medicaid recipients. As for abortion access, many fear Trump \"will seek to impose a federal ban on abortion,\" but that would require congressional approval, said Time. Even if a measure like this does not pass, Trump may pursue \"efforts to restrict access to abortion pills, especially when they are administered through telehealth or delivered by mail,\" said NBC News.\n\nTrump's nomination of Dr. Oz to head the CMS has set off alarm bells. The TV doctor has drawn criticism for \"espousing scientifically dubious theories and promoting treatments with no documented efficacy,\" said Axios. Also, he has \"no experience running a large government bureaucracy like CMS.\" Oz has also publicly backed privatized Medicare, which would require a 20% payroll tax, and that has many \"concerned that low- and middle-income Americans would be responsible for funding the private insurers,\" said Newsweek. Complete privatization could also limit access to doctors and hospitals that don't accept insurance.\nRFK Jr. has been tapped to head the HHS, which oversees the CMS and other health agencies. He is a longtime vaccine skeptic. Removing all vaccine mandates \"would put American children at risk of diseases like measles and polio, which have largely been held at bay by the requirements,\" said The New York Times. His other ideas are also \"wild,\" said Olga Khazan for The Atlantic. \"If his worst ideas come to pass, experts tell me, heart attacks might increase, dental infections might spike, and children might needlessly die of completely preventable diseases.\"\n\nExplore More\n\nToday's big question\nhealth care\npublic health\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nDevika Rao, The Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\n Devika Rao has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022, covering science, the environment, climate and business.

        "summary": "The 5.4 kilometre route will help to better connect Newtownards with Bangor",
        "text": "Work on the ground for the new Newtownards to Bangor greenway has started.\n\nThe new greenway includes three and four metre-wide paths, pedestrian/cycle railing, fencing, lighting and planting. Construction is expected to take around 12 months.\n\n The £5.6 million green infrastructure scheme is being funded by the Stormont Department for Infrastructure, the UK Government’s Levelling Up Fund and Ards and North Down Borugh Council. \n\nREAD MORE: Ards North Down Council asking Just Eat to \"resolve\" situation for scammed restaurants\n\nREAD MORE: Ards North Down Council refuses 5G mast after public outcry\n\n The 5.4 kilometre route will help to better connect the town of Newtownards with the city of Bangor by providing a new safe route for those who want to walk, wheel or cycle. \n\nIt is anticipated that it will be popular with leisure users, those wishing to undertake exercise or to access Whitespots Country Park and Ark Farm, as well as those who are commuting to work or places of study such as the Ards South East Regional College.\n\nThe route is being progressed in two stages. The first is Newtownards to the Somme Museum, beginning at Belvedere Road, Newtownards, and largely following the former railway track to the Somme Museum.\n\nThe second stage, the Somme Museum to Green Road Bangor, will pass the Ark Open Farm and then turn off-road in a north-easterly direction following the former railway line and field boundaries to Green Road, Bangor.\n\nMayor of Ards and North Down, Councillor Alistair Cathcart, said: “Having secured planning permission for these sections of greenway last year, it is fantastic that we have now met all the funding requirements, have a contractor appointed and are ‘on the ground’ in terms of construction.\n\n\"We know that greenways contribute positively to local communities by bringing many health and economic benefits and we look forward to delivering these for the residents of Bangor and Newtownards very soon.”\n\nThe Stormont Infrastructure Minister John O’Dowd welcomed the progress made to be able to start work on the scheme. He said: “I am delighted that my Department could contribute £2.8 million to deliver this greenway project between Bangor and Newtownards .\n\n\"By investing in greenways and active travel infrastructure we are giving more realistic options for people to think about how they travel, particularly for shorter everyday journeys. Once completed this greenway will provide a safe alternative route for those who choose to leave the car at home and use it to travel to work or to study, to shop, to visit family and friends or simply just for leisure.\n\n“By making small changes such as choosing to walk, wheel or cycle we can all make a big difference in beating congestion, reducing our carbon footprint and improving our physical and mental wellbeing.”\n\nFor all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.",

Three of the honorees are retired teachers who inspired students at Laing and other Mount Pleasant area schools for generations.\n\nThe Laing School Tribute and Teacher Appreciation Day was held at the Miriam Moore Brown Community Center in the Old Village, named for the legendary principal who led Laing Elementary for 17 years.\n\nThe celebration featured two outstanding panel discussions that focused on the historic role of Laing School and on the importance of African American leaders as educators and role models in today’s schools.\n\nThe five honorees were:\n\n• James E. Hilton, a retired science and algebra teacher who taught at Laing High School from 1955 to 1970 when the school was closed due to desegregation. He went on to teach at Moultrie and Wando High School;\n\n• Sallie Horry Hilton, a Mount Pleasant native who taught business education at Lincoln High and Laing High School;\n\n• Sue Meriwether Steed, a science teacher who taught at Laing, Moultrie and Wando. She began teaching at Laing after graduating from Winthrop in 1967 — the first African American student to earn a bachelor’s degree there;\n\n• Dorothy E. Fludd, former Laing Alumni Association historian. She worked for 16 years with the New York Public Library, where she rose to become a Supervising Librarian. She returned home in 1984 and worked at the College of Charleston until she retired.\n\n• Walter G. Brown, Jr., retired Charleston County Schools official and Mount Pleasant Historical Commission member. The first African American male to teach in a white school in Charleston, he retired in 1991 as the Director of Federal Programs for the Charleston County School District.\n\nPanelists who spoke at the Tribute program included Mrs. Jeanette P. Singleton, retired Lincoln High School librarian and 1951 graduate of Laing High School; Professor Damon Fordham, historian and adjunct professor at The Citadel; Mount Pleasant Academy principal Kim Jackson; Dr. Micah Behrens, vice principal, Sand Hill Elementary School, Summerville and Karen Smalls-Horlback, retired career and technology educator, Sanders-Clyde Elementary and Wando High School.

We also pay heartfelt tribute to those who rushed to their aid.\n\n“What happened on this day 50 years ago was one of so many dreadful tragedies in a devastating period that touched us all, many of us very personally.”\n\nThe message added: “To see the brave strides forward that have since been made towards lasting peace and meaningful reconciliation, and the close bonds of love and friendship which now bind this city together, makes me exceptionally proud and thankful.\n\n“I must also express my sincere admiration for you, the people of Birmingham, who have lived so courageously with the grief of that day and the days that followed. \n\n“Your exceptional strength of spirit and resolve has truly embodied this wonderful city’s elemental motto: Forward.\n\n“I am very sorry that I cannot be with you all today, but my thoughts, prayers and very best wishes remain with you all as you mark this saddest of days.”\n\nFurther tributes are planned to mark the anniversary this weekend, with Aston Villa planning a minute’s applause in memory of the victims at half-time of their match against Crystal Palace at Villa Park.\n\nThe Library of Birmingham is also being illuminated on Thursday night to mark the 50-year anniversary.",

        "summary": "Dak Prescott was overcome with emotion after witnessing his Dallas Cowboys get embarrassed by the Houston Texans on Monday Night Football.",
        "text": "Dak Prescott can do nothing but sit back and watch the Dallas Cowboys, which is something many folks in The Big D would call torture these days. The reality of the nightmare situation seems to have hit Prescott following the team's embarrassing 34-10 loss at home to the Houston Texans on Monday, which led the signal caller to shed tears, literally. All jokes aside, Prescott being sidelined for the remainder of the season with a bum hamstring is understandably a tough pill to swallow for the former All-Pro. Prescott is the Dallas Cowboys, and the franchise recognized that by handing him a $240 million contract before the season began. Not being able to help his mightily struggling team turn things around made him emotional on Monday night. \"The other day, after the game, I guess, it all just hit me,\" Prescott told Dallas Morning News. \"Boom, right. A couple of tears came down. This is going to hurt. It’s going to suck at times. You just have to understand this is one of the moments that it does. I don’t want anything right now other than to let it suck.\" The Cowboys are 3-7 on the season after picking up their fifth straight loss on Monday night. Backup quarterback Cooper Rush managed to throw for more than 354 yards against Houston, but Dallas' reeling defense continued to look like a shell of its former self. While most Cowboys fans and even neutral fans were sold that Prescott cares deeply about the Cowboys and trying to take the team to that next level, him admitting that he cried after an early November loss in a game he didn't play in certainly proves it. The Cowboys still have games against the New York Giants, Carolina Panthers, and Las Vegas Raiders on the slate, contests most would circle as potential wins, but as things stand right now, you'd be a fool to circle those games in ink.",

They argue that an individual with magnetic capabilities must lean to attract objects, but Ivan does not lean. They also mention that if gravitational force was at play, it would manifest in the video, which it does not.\n\nTests conducted on Ivan have indicated that he does not possess magnetic qualities, as evidenced by a simple compass test where the needle failed to align with any magnetic influence from him.\n\nThe mystery of why objects adhere to the boy’s body remains unsolved. Scientists have reasoned that human skin is naturally coated with grease and oil, which could create a slimy and sticky effect.\n\nby Vandas Voice",

The event, to be held in March or April 2025 at Greylock Glen, aims to break down barriers for Black and Brown communities and inspire long-term engagement in nature.\n\nSeeing Rainbows, a trans-led nonprofit, was awarded $10,000 to expand its Berkshire Trans Hikes, which foster community among trans individuals through outdoor activities. Weekly hikes, facilitated by paid leaders, promote safety and connection in nature for approximately six to 12 participants each week, totaling around 400 people annually.\n\nThe program emphasizes inclusivity by accommodating varying schedules and accessibility needs, and collaborates with the Berkshire Natural Resources Council for trail access. Funding will enhance the initiative's sustainability by covering supplies and stipends, helping to build a supportive and affirming trans community in the Berkshires.",

Look for ‘FREE Delivery to Bahamas’ when you spend over $49 on ‘eligible items’ throughout your shopping journey.\n\n“Once you have a cart with eligible items and exceed the threshold, you will see the ‘Free Delivery’ promotion option at checkout. The promotion is part of our continuous effort to provide greater value to our customers worldwide, and we have not announced an end date to this promotion.”\n\nThis new service has raised concerns among Bahamian retailers, courier companies and freight forwarders about how they will continue to compete with the global online retail giant.\n\nThe Bahamas Chamber of Commerce & Employers Confederation (BCCEC) acknowledged that Amazon’s “free delivery” move poses an “imminent threat” to the survival of several local industries.\n\nThe private sector body, in a statement, urged Bahamian shipping and freight companies to innovate in response to the competitive threat posed by the world’s largest online retailer and e-commerce marketplace offering free delivery to this nation on all purchases of “eligible products” worth $49 or more.\n\nAnd it also called on local retailers to consider how they can diversify their offerings, and digitise products and services, to meet consumers in an increasingly digital and online world. “Indeed, with this new initiative from Amazon, there is an imminent threat to the market share and continuity of a variety of sectors,” said the Chamber in a statement.\n\nThe Chamber also encouraged merchants to improve their competitiveness by implementing initiatives that benefit consumers, such as loyalty programmes and bulk discounts, to incentivise consumers to shop locally.\n\nMr Rolle said he supports the chamber’s view and said firms implementing more benefits for consumers would help them to retain their existing clients and attract new clients while making the industry more competitive.",

Our interest is basically the national interest. \n\n“We believe that lifting up this curtain of secrecy and mischief will move the nation forward, encourage the Armed Forces and indeed the security forces all over the nation, as the sacrifice to secure us.\n\n“We, therefore, call on all lovers of peace and workers with God to join us to condemn this orchestrated onslaught against those men who have decided to haphazard their lives so that we can live in peace and quiet.\n\n“We call on the CNS to remain focused, unfazed and resilient in his dogged fight as success is just around the corner, and to discountenance the allegation as those that are with you are more than those against you”.\n\nREAD MORE FROM: NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\n\n\r\n\r\nGet real-time news updates from Tribune Online!

On Monday, Mace pushed forward a similar resolution about transgender people in the U.S. Capitol, a measure she said was \"100% because of\" congresswoman-elect Sarah McBride (D-Del.), adding that the newly elected trans woman \"doesn't get a say\" in the policy.\n\nWho said what\n\"The radical left says I'm a 'threat,'\" Mace said on X after introducing her bill. \"You better believe it.\" Republicans have \"increasingly amplified anti-trans messaging in recent years and it's morphed into a common political talking point,\" NPR said. Mace alone has made \"hundreds\" of social media posts \"about the bathroom issue in recent days,\" framing it as a safety issue, The Washington Post said.\n\nThe federal transgender bathroom bill — which also \"appears to extend\" to Washington, D.C., \"libraries, recreation centers and, potentially, D.C. Public Schools\" — is \"unlikely to overcome the Senate filibuster,\" the Post said, and it would run afoul of changes President Joe Biden made to Title IX. But a majority of the GOP-controlled House could approve Mace's resolution for the Capitol. McBride said yesterday she was \"not here to fight about bathrooms,\" but to \"fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

        "title": "'Exceeded our predictions': Potentially one of the largest fisheries in Australia is sitting offshore, untapped",
        "summary": "A study last year identified a sardine population stretching from NSW's south coast to Tasmania could rival the biggest fishery in Australia — and there's a push to make use of it.",
        "text": "Off the north-east coast of Tasmania, could be one of the largest fishery resources in the country.\n\nCommercial fisher Stuart Richey knows it's there. He's spent more than a decade advocating for it to be set up.\n\n\"Our family has been in aerial fish spotting for 50 years in Tasmania, and we were noticing more and more sardines along beaches, which is a little bit unusual,\" Mr Richey, who owns Richey Fishing, said.\n\nAlong with fellow fisher Allan Barnett, Mr Richey estimates he has spent about $400,000 on equipment, nets, research and trips to another sardine fishery, in South Australia, in his push for a potential Tasmanian fishery.\n\nIt now looks to be a step closer to reality.\n\nThe Tasmanian department responsible for fisheries, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment (NRE), says it is in \"the early investigation stage of considering if a fishery for Australian sardine can be developed\".\n\nConfirming the actual biomass size of the sardine population and what would constitute a sustainable take are the current focus of research.\n\nA report by researchers from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) last year identified an enormous sardine population extending from New South Wales's south coast to Tasmania's east coast.\n\nThe report estimated a total biomass of just under 350,000 tonnes, which could \"sustain an annual catch of several tens of thousands of tonnes\".\n\nIt would make it the largest catch of any Australian fishery, the report read, apart from the South Australian sardine fishery (SASF) — the largest fishery by volume.\n\nAn NRE spokesperson said a more refined estimate of its size is the focus of a new IMAS report this year, to be released later this year.\n\nThe spokesperson did not answer questions from the ABC about the size of a potential fishery.\n\nWait of more than a decade 'hugely frustrating'\n\nIn 2013, Mr Richey contacted then-Labor deputy premier Bryan Green to discuss how he could get a trial fishery started, based on using South Australia's fishery as a model.\n\nSince then, Mr Richey said he had \"been through a variety of fisheries ministers\".\n\nThe Tasmania Blue Seafood processing facility in Huonville, which he co-purchased in February this year with KSF Australia, was also intended to be used for sardine processing.\n\n\"It is hugely frustrating in that everything we've predicted has so far exceeded our predictions,\" he said.\n\n\"[Processing facilities] like this could be just going flat out, processing these things at a very low level — we don't need to be a big fishery.\"\n\n'We need solid science', IMAS researcher says\n\nDr Tim Ward, an Associate Professor of Fisheries Science and the lead author on the 2023 fishery report, said a sustainable fishery was possible.\n\nIf a fishery was to be set up, Dr Ward said catch rates needed to start low and a more comprehensive population survey needed to be conducted.\n\nSince he first prepared a report for NRE in 2022, population estimates across the area have doubled.\n\n\"I think we were all quite surprised — we hadn't done a comprehensive survey of the stock,\" he said.\n\nAn NRE spokesperson said it would assess this year's population update \"in further considering how a sustainable sardine fishery might be developed in consultation with stakeholders\".\n\nDr Ward said a precautionary approach was needed.\n\n\"We need to look locally at the ecological dependence of predators on sardines, and so, understand what the implications are locally for Tasmania and Victoria,\" he said.\n\nSocial licence questioned after super trawler saga\n\nThe Australian Marine Conservation Society's (AMCS) Adrian Meder said he was unconvinced a Tasmanian fishery could be operated sustainably.\n\n\"Tasmanians, and indeed Australians, rejected in the strongest terms the idea of industrial fishing when we had the super trawler turn up,\" Mr Meder said.\n\nIn 2012, the 143-metre long FV Margiris – the second-largest factory trawler ship in the world – entered Tasmanian waters.\n\nThe super trawler was approved to catch an 18,000-tonne quota of pelagic fish in the Commonwealth Small Pelagic Fishery, which includes waters off Tasmania's coast.\n\nSupporters argued that the vessel was economically efficient, the risk of catching dolphins and seals was minimal and could be mitigated, and prescribed catch limits would restrict any impact to fish stocks.\n\nEnvironmental and fishing groups feared the trawler's catch rate would devastate pelagic fish populations, depriving other fish and seabirds of an important food source.\n\nThe federal government ended the debate by banning super trawlers over 130 metres in length from Australian waters in 2015.\n\n\"So, the next question is, will we actually respect that and will that be reflected in what decisions are made on where this fishery can go?\" Mr Meder said.\n\n\"I think its going to have impacts that run completely counter to what we already know about what's acceptable to the Australian community and where that social licence extends to.\"\n\nMr Richey wants to dispel images of massive super trawlers, and said he isn't advocating for a big fishery.\n\n\"It's got to start at a very low level first,\" he said. \n\n\"It may finish up a bigger fishery, but it's got to start at a low level. And the boats [to be used] are here in Tasmania.\"\n\nDr Ward said there were ecological and economic risks associated with over-exploiting a resource.\n\n\"But I think what we've learned in the South Australian sardine fishery (SASF) and in the Commonwealth Small Pelagic Fishery is that those risks can be managed,\" he said.\n\nCould Port Lincoln be a template?\n\nSouth Australia's sardine fishery, based in Port Lincoln, employs over 200 full-time workers and generated over $31 million last year.\n\nIt is considered a template for a possible Tasmanian fishery.\n\nBy volume it is the largest fishery in the country, with over 46,000 tonnes caught last year, and it uses the \"purse-seine\" fishing method rather than trawling – a more targeted approach that uses smaller boats, with less risk of bycatch.\n\nThe market for human consumption of sardines in Australia is low and over 95 per cent of sardines caught in South Australia are used to feed to other fish in the aquaculture industry.\n\nThe potential for a future Tasmanian sardine fishery to perform a similar role, by supplementing the state's well-established salmon aquaculture industry, was highlighted in the 2023 IMAS report.\n\nThe absence of a Tasmanian sardine fishery, it read, \"limits the opportunity for the salmon industry to obtain the tens of thousands of tonnes of forage fish that it needs annually from a sustainable local source.\"\n\nSardines may head 'straight to fish farms'\n\nMr Meder said a small, sustainable fishery could be established, but he didn't believe it would remain that size.\n\n\"The bulk of that fishery, in order for it to be economic, is going to be headed straight to fish farm production,\" Mr Meder said.\n\n\"And every time we go out there, we've proven to have unacceptable impacts on things like dolphins and seals — the bycatch has been way out of step with community expectations.\"\n\nFor his part, Mr Richey said he believed a human consumption market was viable too.\n\n\"We're missing out, but Tasmania's missing out because we've got this resource, we're not utilising it, we're not employing people, we're just stagnating with it.\"",

        "title": "'Derry City will go nowhere without proper facilities says Sean Barrett",
        "summary": "​SEAN BARRETT was admittedly 'blown away' by the standard of facilities at Larne Football Club during a recent visit to Inver Park and the Derry City Chief Executive knows the Brandywell club will 'go nowhere' until they get their own house in order.",
        "text": "Now the Brandywell club has managed to wrestle the man who guided Larne to unprecedented success both domestically and in Europe from the grip of the Irish League champions, Barrett believes it's time to marry success on the pitch with developments off it. The football club held another meeting with Brandywell owners Derry City and Strabane District Council on Wednesday about the replacement of the current artificial surface at the ground and a Council spokesperson said similar meetings will take place 'on a regular basis to discuss a range of issues including the ongoing works that are being carried out at the Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium.' Chairman, Philip O'Doherty has funded the erection of the new North Terrace at the Brandywell Road end and Mr Barrett insists plans are afoot for a new training base for the club. Tiernan Lynch claims Derry City need somewhere to call 'home' in terms of having a training facility where he has plans to develop the structures of the football club. \"You need a home,\" said Lynch. \"You need somewhere where you can build that culture. That culture isn't built on a football pitch over 90 minutes. That culture is built on the blood and the sweat and the tears you give every single day. \"And I think that's something when you have a home and are able to add those levels of professionalism and you're able to get your analysis done and they're eating together and you're able to control what they're eating and understanding their weights and their body fats that you can get them watching their games together and understanding the areas we need to improve as a team. \"But also understand the areas we're doing really well as a team. All that happens on the training field. That's not something that happens at the Brandywell. \"The more time we spend together and the more we get to know each other and all that will help add to the culture.\" And Barrett agrees Derry City must emulate the incredible progress and off-pitch developments made by Larne during the seven-and-a-half years Lynch was at the helm. The Belfast man will no doubt have a major say in plans for the planned state-of-the-art training facility and Barrett revealed he will be involved in the interview process for the recently advertised Head of Youth Academy. With the new stand on schedule to be completed by the start of next season, Barrett reckons it's an 'exciting time' for the club. “We need to get the facilities right otherwise we’ll be going nowhere. The new stand's getting built will be finished now in February, we're hoping to continue the facilities here at the Brandywell as well as the new state of the art facility for the training academy with three pitches, so all that and all that going forward as a club Tiernan has shown and proved that. “I went up to Larne just to have a look around and I was blown away by what I seen there, it was fabulous facilities and I really, I said look, we need to emulate this. \"Ninety nine from 100 people would say Derry's a bigger club than Larne but the facilities that they have compared to ours . . . what these guys have done over the last five or six years has been absolutely fantastic.”",

        "title": "Defamation suit can proceed against Sun-Times over Trump Tower stories, Illinois Supreme Court rules",
        "summary": null,
        "text": "The Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that a defamation lawsuit linked to Chicago Sun-Times coverage of a Trump Tower property tax appeal should proceed against the newspaper because it didn’t prove that a former state official it reported on had filed his civil complaint in order “to silence citizen participation.”\n\nIn a 6-0 decision with one justice taking no part, the state’s top court ruled the suit filed by ex-Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board executive director Mauro Glorioso wasn’t lodged against the Sun-Times “solely based on defendant’s exercise of political rights.”\n\nGlorioso is suing the newspaper over a 2020 article about an anonymous complaint that accused him of improperly pushing for a property tax break on Donald Trump’s namesake riverfront tower.\n\nThe state Supreme Court didn’t rule on Glorioso’s defamation claim against the newspaper, but rather on the Sun-Times’ argument that his lawsuit should have been dismissed under the Illinois Citizen Participation Act.\n\nThat state law is intended to empower courts to swiftly throw out any meritless, retaliatory lawsuit known as a “Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation” — or SLAPP — which “chills and diminishes citizen participation in government” through the threat of expensive litigation, the 2007 legislation reads.\n\nLower courts ruled that Glorioso’s suit was not a SLAPP because it was not filed solely on the basis of the Sun-Times exercise of First Amendment rights — and that the newspaper did not prove that the suit was retaliatory and meritless.\n\nIllinois Supreme Court Justice David Overstreet affirmed in the unanimous opinion that Glorioso’s suit “is not a SLAPP,” ruling that the Citizen Participation Act “specifically protects government participation and does not encompass all media reports on matters of public concern.”\n\nThe justices remanded the case to proceed in circuit court.\n\nThe Sun-Times has stood behind the accuracy of investigative reporter Tim Novak’s story, which was published in February 2020.\n\nNovak reported that an anonymous complaint prompted investigations by the state’s executive inspector general’s office as well as Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker’s office into whether Glorioso, a Republican attorney, had pressured staff to give Trump a $1 million property tax refund on Trump Tower. \n\nPritzker previously appointed Glorioso executive director of the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board, which can overrule county officials’ decisions on property tax assessments, potentially reducing owners’ tax bills.\n\nDuring the investigation by the Illinois Office of Executive Inspector General, Pritzker removed Glorioso from his position in October 2020, citing concerns over a backlog of cases.\n\nGlorioso then sued Novak and the Sun-Times in January 2021 for allegedly misrepresenting the nature of the complaint about how the Trump case was handled.\n\nThe OEIG later deemed “unfounded” the anonymous complaint against Glorioso — but the watchdog agency still ruled in September 2021 that Glorioso violated state law and policy by deleting files and emails related to Trump’s tax appeal.\n\nThe deletions came days after the Sun-Times asked for such records under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, the state law that provides public access to government records.\n\nThe Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press had urged justices to dismiss Glorioso’s lawsuit and reinforce anti-SLAPP precedent.\n\n“Time and again, these laws have protected journalists and news organizations from lawsuits seeking to silence their reporting. Without the full protections of laws like the [Citizen Participation Act], journalists and news organizations may avoid important stories out of fear of being hit with a financially burdensome or even ruinous SLAPP,” committee leaders said in a statement.\n\nBut the state Supreme Court noted the law doesn’t make “any mention of news media or the freedom of the press.\n\n“This is not to minimize or understate the importance of the press and other news media in our democracy. Our jurisprudence is replete with privileges and other protections designed to protect these concerns, many of which remain at issue in this lawsuit,” Overstreet wrote. “We are simply holding that the Act specifically protects government participation and does not encompass all media reports on matters of public concern as advocated by defendants.”\n\nReacting to the court’s ruling, Damon Dunn, the Sun-Times lawyer in the case, said, \"[A]t a time when the First Amendment is under siege, it is disappointing that the court declined to revisit its prior opinion and protect speech on matters of public concern under our Illinois statute, particularly when other states recently took steps to ensure their SLAPP laws protect news reports on the conduct of government officials.\n\n“The newspaper looks forward to proving this case is meritless under the constitutional protections for the press that the Court recognizes are still at issue,” Dunn added, “and getting to the bottom of why the Trump Tower tax appeal was handled the way it was.” \n\nPhillip Zisook, an attorney for Glorioso, lauded the court’s decision, saying Glorioso appreciated its “thorough analysis of the Illinois Citizen Participation Act... and finding that the Defendants’ news articles did not constitute acts in furtherance of government participation protected by the Act.”",

This is because they can stop the immune system from functioning properly, so the body is less effective at clearing infections and can send the immune system into overdrive (sepsis), causing damage to our major organs.\n\n The researchers had noted during the Covid-19 pandemic there was an increase in the number of children being admitted to hospitals worldwide with what looked like a severe bacterial infection, with high fever, red eyes, rashes and very low blood pressure. \n\nIn reality, the children had MIS-C, a condition that can develop about four weeks after Covid-19 infection due to immune malfunction.\n\n The present study sheds light on how children’s immune systems respond to a fever and could lead to better treatments for a range of illnesses. The work was led by a consortium of researchers at Imperial College London, King’s College London and the University of Edinburgh. \n\n“For decades we have been working to unpick the granular detail of febrile illnesses, so we can improve treatments and reduce the impact these conditions have on children,” says Professor Michael Levin of Imperial College, who led the work alongside Edinburgh University’s Professor Manu Shankar-Hari.\n\n“As clinicians, we may often see a child in the hospital or clinic with a fever and no other real defining symptoms, making an accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment difficult,” he adds.\n\nThe aim of their project, therefore, is to provide a clearer picture of how the immune system works in febrile illnesses and help doctors diagnose children earlier and get them the treatment they need sooner.\n\nSo they looked at different immune cells in blood samples taken from 128 children with different febrile illnesses: MIS-C (multi-system inflammatory syndrome of childhood associated with Covid-19 infection); severe bacterial infections; severe viral infections; and Kawasaki disease (a rare, severe inflammatory disease in children).\n\nWhat they found was impairment of immune cells, particularly T cells, in children with MIS-C and severe bacterial infection, plus decreases in inflammatory markers called interferons – proteins that help to clear viruses from the body.\n\n“In the clinic currently, our treatments for dysfunctional immunity tend to be poor and not targeted to individual children,” believes Dr Michael Carter of King’s College London.\n\nThe aim is to develop a simple blood test to diagnose rapidly the cause of a childhood febrile illness.",

        "text": "The King has shared a traditional greeting gesture with a Maori advocate at the official launch of his environmental charity.\n\nCharles, 76, shared a hongi – a traditional Maori greeting where two people press their noses together – with Mere Takoko, the co-founder of Pacific Whale Fund, at the launch of the King’s Circular Bioeconomy Alliance (CBA).\n\nMs Takoko, whose organisation works to protect the ocean and marine life in the Pacific Ocean, hailed the shared gesture as “hugely symbolic”.\n\nWearing a blue kakahu, a traditional Maori garment, Ms Takoko attended St James’s Palace alongside dozens of other organisations, including fashion houses Brunello Cucinelli and Giorgio Armani, and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, to celebrate the CBA’s official launch.\n\nThe King’s organisation, which was first established in 2020 and became an officially registered charity in 2023, aims to support the global transition towards a “climate neutral economy”.\n\nSpeaking after she greeted the King, Ms Takoko, who came from Gisborne in the upper North Island of New Zealand, said it was “vitally important” for her to greet Charles.\n\n“I came here in the spirit of reconciliation, friendship, and unity,” she said.\n\nTalking about the late Maori King Tuheitia, who died in August this year, Ms Takoko said: “From the Maori king’s perspective, they enjoyed a very strong friendship and this legacy must be maintained.\n\n“We are two peoples but bound together through the treaty of Waitangi, which his ancestors signed, and my ancestors signed.”\n\nShe added that she wanted to “continue to celebrate that relationship at a time which is quite divisive”.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been protesting outside New Zealand’s parliament in Wellington this week.\n\nThey oppose a controversial Bill seeking to reinterpret the country’s 1840 Treaty of Waitangi between British colonisers and Maori people, which many critics say is an attempt to take rights away from Maori people.\n\nDuring the reception, Charles greeted the CBA’s founders and trustees in the Throne Room of St James’s Palace, before moving on to the Entree room to speak to attendees.\n\nAt one point, the King stopped to admire a pashmina produced by the fashion brand Brunello Cucinelli using fine wool from Ladakh in the Indian Himalayas that has been produced through regenerative farming.\n\n“It’s amazing, isn’t it?” he said, touching the fabric.\n\nCharles was also shown cotton grown in Puglia, southern Italy, to produce T-shirts made by Armani.\n\nOne of these T-shirts has been sent to the King as a gift, along with one of the pashminas.",

        "summary": "Grayson’s three accomplices managed to escape execution because they were under 18 at the time of Deblieux’s murder",
        "text": "A man convicted for the brutal slaying of hitchhiker Vickie Lynn Deblieux in 1994 is scheduled to be executed with nitrogen gas by the state of Alabama on Thursday. \n\nCarey Daley Grayson, 49, was 19 when he and three others tortured, beat, and mutilated Deblieux, 37, on February 21, 1994. \n\nIf Grayson is executed Thursday, he will be the 22nd inmate to be put to death this year, and Alabama's sixth this year and third in two months, according to the Montgomery Advertiser. \n\nWhat led Grayson and the other teens to target and murder Deblieux, and why are some anti-death penalty advocates protesting the method the state will use to kill him? \n\nOn February 21, 1994, Deblieux was dropped off by her friend in Chattanooga near Interstate 59, where she began hitchhiking to continue her trip southwest, according to USA TODAY.\n\nAt the same time, Grayson and three other teens were driving near Birmingham, Alabama, and spotted Deblieux on the side of the road looking for a ride. \n\nThe group stopped for Deblieux and invited her to ride with them. They then drove to nearby wooded area of Bald Mountain — and reportedly justified the stop by telling Deblieux they were swapping out vehicles — where they began attacking her. \n\nThe teens beat and kicked her outside of the car before Grayson and another teen ultimately killed her by standing on her throat. \n\nThe group threw her body from a cliff, and later returned to the area to mutilate her corpse. They cut the woman's body at least 180 times, cut off her fingers, and removed a portion of her lungs, court records show.\n\nInvestigators became aware of Deblieux's death rock climbers stumbled across her remains near Bald Mountain four days after the attack had taken place.\n\nPolice began investigating the teens after they received a report that one of them had shown Deblieux's finger to a friend. \n\nThey later learned that Grayson's girlfriend at the time had found and him and his friends sleeping in a truck in Birmingham the night after they mutilated Deblieux's corpse. She recalled them being covered in mud and blood, but Grayson lied and said the blood had come from a dog. \n\nAll four of the teens involved — Grayson, Kenny Loggins, Trace Duncan, and Louis Mangione — were charged with capital murder, convicted, and sentenced to death. \n\nDuncan, Loggins, and Mangione had their death sentences commuted in 2005 after the Supreme Court banned the execution of anyone younger than 18 when a crime was committed. The trio were instead sentenced life in prison without the possibility of parole. \n\nLoggins has since attempted to have his sentence reduced further, arguing that it is unconstitutional to sentence someone to prison for life for a crime they committed before they turned 18, but his argument was rejected by the courts.\n\nGrayson was 19 at the time of the murder, so his sentence was not commuted. \n\nAlabama is scheduled to execute Grayson at 6 p.m. local time. Grayson is currently being held at Holman Correctional Facility — a little over 60 miles northeast of Mobile — where the sentence will be carried out.\n\nIn Alabama, inmates can choose to die by either nitrogen hypoxia, lethal injection or electrocution, with Grayson selecting the former. The controversial method was only used for the first time this year, when Alabama executed Kenneth Eugene Smith in January. \n\nThe unusual method of Smith’s execution sparked international backlash, including a protest from the Vatican.\n\nGrayson is one of about 30 inmates on Alabama’s death row who have selected to die by nitrogen hypoxia. During the execution, the condemned person breathes in pure nitrogen through a mask, displacing the oxygen in their system. Proponents claim it is an instant and painless death, opponents claim it is untried and amounts to torture.\n\nDuring Smith’s execution, he reportedly writhed and convulsed on a gurney for at least four minutes, rather than losing consciousness \"within seconds,\" as the state had previously predicted. \n\nDespite those issues, the state's Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm defended the execution as \"textbook.\" \n\nGrayson’s last chance to avoid death is to obtain a reprieve from the US Supreme Court and Republican Governor Kay Ivey.\n\nHowever, when the Montgomery Advertiser pointed out to Ivey that Grayson was going to be executed the week before Thanksgiving, she showed little sympathy for the inmate. \n\n\"Did Carey Grayson give any consideration to the fact that he robbed Vicki DeBlieux and her family of now 30 Thanksgivings?\" she replied. \n\nGrayson suffers from bipolar disorder and a forensic psychologist testified during his trial that he was in a \"manic state\" during the murder. \n\nThe psychologist also noted, however, that Grayson had the capacity to differentiate between right and wrong in that moment, and that his actions cannot be dismissed based on his mental health struggles.",

        "text": "The developers behind Grand Bahama’s $250m Six Senses resort project have begun site clearance in preparation for an official groundbreaking in the 2025 first quarter.\n\nWeller Development Partners and Pegasus Capital Advisors, in a statement, said the project team has started by identifying and removing invasive casuarina pine trees, installing construction fencing and project signage, and the building of viewing platforms and a temporary boat dock. The latter will facilitate site tours for potential buyers of properties among the Six Senses Residences.\n\nThey added that to further prioritise sustainable development, trees marked for clearing will be ground down and used as landfill, thus reducing the number of vehicles needed for removal. The high-end resort development is forecast to create around 400 construction jobs and around 200 permanent posts.\n\n“Our approach to development has always been rooted in environmental responsibility,” said Marc Weller, Weller Development’s founding partner. “We are committed to maintaining and enhancing the natural ecosystem of Grand Bahama, and creating a model for sustainable development that actively contributes to the restoration and preservation of the area.”\n\nSix Senses Grand Bahama is targeting LEED Silver certification, and will incorporate numerous sustainability and resiliency measures, including the use of locally-sourced construction materials; energy conservation efforts such as passive shading and high-efficiency mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) systems; and significant beach restoration and reinforced dune systems.\n\nThe developers added that a key focus is on hurricane preparedness. This involves building foundations that raise the Finished Floor Elevation (FFE) substantially, and a reinforced, structural dune system will be implemented along the property’s seaside coastline to block storm surge.\n\nWeller Development Partners said it is collaborating with several environmental organisations to ensure the project contributes positively to local ecosystems. During construction, for safety reasons Fortune Bay Road leading into the site will be closed. The developers promised to work with the community to ensure convenient pedestrian access to the beach for all residents during and after construction.\n\nSix Senses Grand Bahama is targeted for completion in the 2026 fourth quarter, and will feature a 50-acre eco-conscious resort community including 70 resort guest rooms, 38 of which are villas, and 28 branded residences. It will be designed by architecture firms, Gensler and Olson Kundig, respectively.",

        "summary": "The Russian strike on Ukraine on Thursday came in response to Ukrainian strikes on the Russian territory with U.S. and British missiles earlier this week, Putin said.",
        "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Thursday that Moscow has tested a new intermediate-range missile in a strike on Ukraine, and he warned that it could use the weapon against countries that have allowed Kyiv to use their missiles to strike Russia.\n\nThe Russian strike on Ukraine on Thursday came in response to Ukrainian strikes on the Russian territory with U.S. and British missiles earlier this week, Putin said during a nationwide TV address.\n\nPutin declared that Russia would issue advance warnings if it launches more strikes with such missile against Ukraine to allow civilians to evacuate to safety.\n\nHe warned that U.S. air defense systems wouldn’t be capable of intercepting Russian missiles.\n\nPutin’s announcement came hours after Ukraine claimed that Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile overnight at the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. But American officials said an initial U.S. assessment indicated the strike was carried out with an intermediate-range ballistic missile.\n\nTwo people were wounded in the attack, and an industrial facility and a rehabilitation center for people with disabilities were damaged, according to local officials.\n\nThe attack comes in a week when tensions have repeatedly soared, as the U.S. eased restrictions on Ukraine’s use of American-made longer-range missiles inside Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for launching nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said in a statement that the attack on Dnipro was launched from Russia’s Astrakhan region, on the Caspian Sea.\n\n“Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “And how afraid he is.”\n\nBallistic missiles can have a range of anywhere from under 500 kilometers (310 miles) to over 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles) in the case of intercontinental ones. “Ballistic” refers to the shape of their trajectory.\n\nThe attack comes during a week of soaring tensions in the war.\n\nEarlier this week, the Biden administration authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied, longer-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia — a move that drew an angry response from Moscow.\n\nDays later, Ukraine fired several of the missiles into Russia, according to the Kremlin. The same day, Putin signed a new doctrine that allows for a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power.\n\nThe doctrine is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons. In response, Western countries, including the U.S., said Russia has used irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior throughout the war to intimidate Ukraine and other nations.\n\nThey have also expressed dismay at the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine.\n\nAlso Thursday, Russia also struck Zelenskyy’s home city of Kryvyi Rih, wounding 26 people, said the head of regional administration, Serhii Lysak. The missile strike caused damage to an administrative building, at least five multistory residential buildings, and civilian vehicles.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said in a statement that its air defense systems shot down two British-made Storm Shadow missiles, six HIMARS rockets, and 67 drones.\n\nThe statement didn’t say when or where the Storm Shadows were shot down or what they were targeting. Russia earlier reported downing some of the missiles over the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula.\n\nMore than 1,000 days into war, Russia has the upper hand, with its larger army advancing in Donetsk and Ukrainian civilians suffering from relentless drone and missile strikes.\n\nAnalysts and observers say that the loosening of restrictions on Ukraine’s use of Western missiles is unlikely to change the the course of the war, but it puts the Russian army in a more vulnerable position and could complicate the logistics that are crucial in warfare.\n\nPutin has also warned that the move would mean that Russia and NATO are at war.\n\n“It is an important move and it pulls against, undermines the narrative that Putin had been trying to establish that it was fine for Russia to rain down Iranian drones and North Korean missiles on Ukraine but a reckless escalation for Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons at legitimate targets in Russia,” said Peter Ricketts, a former U.K. national security adviser who now sits in the House of Lords.\n\n—Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London and Aamer Madhani, Tara Copp and Lolita C.

        "summary": "USC has announced that it will name its newly renovated School of&#8230;",
        "text": "USC has announced that it will name its newly renovated School of Dramatic Arts building the the Dick Wolf Drama Center after the Emmy-winning creator of the Law & Order TV franchise who has made what the university says supported the endeavor with a “significant contribution.”\n\nIn a statement, Wolf said, “Education has always been a priority for me and for Wolf Entertainment. It is my privilege to be associated with USC and this state-of-the-art facility. At Wolf Entertainment we will have our eye on the next generation of talent to emerge from the School of Dramatic Arts.”\n\nThe newly named Dick Wolf Drama Center opened in February 2024 as a reimagining of the former United University Church, a historic building on campus. According to USC, “a point was made to retain the 1930s-style architecture — complete with stone engravings, spiral columns and stained-glass windows — but the interior was completely redone for the modern age.”\n\nWith the remodeling, students have access to a professional development center where they can record auditions and collaborate with peers. The building also has an integrated media lab, recording studios and dressing rooms. Along with those improvements, the building also features two new theaters: the Sanctuary Theatre and the Stop Gap Theatre — the latter named after a former streetcar station at the south edge of campus that was converted into one of the department’s first theater spaces in 1948.\n\nUSC President Carol Folt said. “I am so honored that Dick’s name will grace this perfect and appropriate home for our world-renowned, conservatory-level artistic hub in the heart of our campus. Since its founding, USC has produced award-winning artists and creatives who help us make sense of our ever-changing world. Our students and faculty will continue to be inspired in our new Dick Wolf Drama Center every day.”\n\nEmily Roxworthy, dean of the School of Dramatic Arts, said, “We are thrilled and grateful that Dick has made a commitment to our students here at USC. Our state-of-the-art facility, with its unique services like a dedicated professional development center and Sparks Center for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, serves as a bridge to Hollywood and a support system for young artists as they navigate their way into ever-evolving creative industries.”\n\nRoxworthy added, “Dick’s career has enabled so many stage and screen actors to launch and sustain their own careers through game-changing roles in his shows, and we are exceptionally proud to continue this work with his support.”\n\nIn addition to serving as creator and executive producer of all the Law & Order-branded series, Wolf has extended his branding to other series including Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., Chicago Med, FBI, FBI Most Wanted, FBI International and the new Amazon Prime series On Call. Wolf’s company also produced the Oscar-winning documentary Twin Towers.",

        "summary": "At a delicate moment in the U.S. — and for the world — Biden’s silence may be leaving a vacuum.",
        "text": "By AAMER MADHANI and COLLEEN LONG\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has been notably quiet since the Democrats’ gut-wrenching defeat at the polls.\n\nAfter warning voters for years that a Donald Trump win would be calamitous for American democracy, Biden has gone largely silent on his concerns about what lays ahead for America and he has yet to substantively reflect on why Democrats were decisively defeated up and down the ballot.\n\nHis only public discussion of the outcome of the election came in a roughly six-minute speech in the Rose Garden two days after the election, when he urged people to “see each other not as adversaries but as fellow Americans” and to “bring down the temperature.” Since then, there’s been hardly a public peep — including over the course of Biden’s six-day visit to South America that concluded on Tuesday evening. His only public comments during the trip came during brief remarks before meetings with government officials and a climate-related speech during a visit to the Amazon.\n\nAt a delicate moment in the U.S. — and for the world — Biden’s silence may be leaving a vacuum. But his public reticence has also underscored a new reality: America and the rest of the world is already moving on.\n\n“His race is over. His day is done,” said David Axelrod, who served as a senior adviser in the Obama-Biden White House. “It’s up to a new generation of leaders to chart the path forward, as I’m sure they will.”\n\nEdward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis, said Biden’s relative silence in the aftermath of the Republican win is in some ways understandable. Still, he argued, there’s good reason for Biden to be more active in trying to shape the narrative during his final months in office.\n\n“The last time a president left office so irrelevant or rejected by the populace was Jimmy Carter,” said Frantz, referring to the last one-term Democrat in the White House. “History has allowed for the great rehabilitation of Carter, in part, because of all he did in his post-presidency. At 82, I’m not sure Biden has the luxury of time. The longer he waits, the longer he can’t find something to say, he risks ceding shaping his legacy at least in how he’s seen in the near term.”\n\nBiden’s allies say the president — like Democrats writ large — is privately processing the election defeat, stressing that it’s barely been two weeks since Trump’s win. Biden hasn’t been vocally introspective about his role in the loss, and still has a lot to unpack, they said.\n\nBiden, in his speech after the election, said: “Campaigns are contests of competing visions. The country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made. I’ve said many times you can’t love your country only when you win.”\n\nBiden’s aides say the president’s insistence on following electoral traditions — ensuring an orderly transition and inviting Trump to the White House — is especially important because Trump flouted them four years ago, when he actively tried to overturn the results of the election he lost and helped incite a mob that rioted at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean Biden isn’t privately stewing over the results even as he doesn’t say much in public.\n\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates said Biden believes that it is “critical to respect the will of the voters by providing an orderly transition and peaceful transfer of power. President Biden was honest with the American people about the stakes for democracy, and his views are unchanged — which is all the more reason to uphold his principles and lead by example.”\n\nDuring his six-day visit to Peru and Brazil for meetings with global leaders, Biden declined to hold a news conference — typically a set piece for American presidents during such travel. Biden already was far less likely to hold news conferences than his contemporaries, but his staff often points to off-the-cuff moments when he answers questions from reporters who travel everywhere with him. In this case, he’s yet to engage even in an impromptu Q&A on the election or other matters.\n\nAnd notably this week, Biden left it to allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Justin Trudeau of Canada to offer public explanations of his critical decision to loosen restrictions on Ukraine’s use of longer-range American weapons in its war with Russia.\n\nBiden, for whom Ukraine has been a major focal point of his presidency, had long been concerned about escalation should the U.S. relax restrictions, and was cognizant of how Moscow might respond had he seemed to be thumping his chest at President Vladimir Putin. But Ukraine has also been a touchy subject because of Trump, who has claimed he’d end the war immediately and has long espoused admiration for Putin.\n\nThe GOP victory — Trump won both the popular vote and Electoral College count, and Republicans won control of Congress — comes as the president and Vice President Kamala Harris have both sounded dire alarms over what a Trump presidency might mean. Harris called Trump a fascist. Biden told Americans the very foundation of the nation was at stake, and he said world leaders, too, were concerned.\n\n“Every international meeting I attend,” Biden said after a trip in September to Germany, “they pull me aside — one leader after the other, quietly — and say, ‘Joe, he can’t win. My democracy is at stake.’”\n\nHis voice rising, Biden then asked if “America walks away, who leads the world? Who? Name me a country.”\n\nPerhaps the most important moment of his time in South America was a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru. His public comments at the start of that meeting were notably more backward looking than Xi’s, the leader of America’s most powerful geopolitical competitor.\n\n“I’m very proud of the progress we’ve both made together,” said Biden, fondly recalling a visit near the Tibetan plateau with Xi years ago. He added, “We haven’t always agreed, but our conversations have always been candid and always been frank.”\n\nXi, by contrast, looked past Biden in his remarks and sought to send a clear message to Trump.\n\n“China is ready to work with the new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation, and manage differences so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-U.S. relationship for the benefit of the two peoples,” Xi said, while urging American leadership to make a “wise choice” as it manages the relationship.\n\nThe president also seemed in no mood to engage with reporters throughout his time in South America. Since Election Day, he’s only briefly acknowledged media questions twice.\n\nThe terse answers and silence haven’t stopped reporters from trying to engage him.\n\nOver the course of his six-day trip, he ignored questions about his decision on providing antipersonnel mines to Ukraine, reflections on the election, and even why he’s not answering questions from the press.\n\nAs he got ready to board Air Force One in Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday to make his way home, one reporter even tried endearing herself to the president by pointing to Biden’s 82nd birthday on Wednesday.\n\n“Mr. President, happy early birthday! For your birthday, will you talk to us, sir?” the reporter said. “As a gift to the press will you please talk to us? Mr. President! President Biden, please! We haven’t heard from you all trip!”\n\nBiden got on the plane without answering.",

        "summary": "The landlord failed to transfer the licence when becoming a private limited company",
        "text": "Belfast Council has turned down a HMO application for a street in the Stranmillis area with more than three times the council limit on multiple occupation homes.\n\n Elected representatives at the November meeting of the Belfast City Council Licensing Committee rejected an application for a new HMO licence by Torrbeg Properties Ltd for 10 Sandymount Street, Belfast, BT9 on the basis of overprovision of HMOs in the area. \n\nThe property has been owned for over 30 years by the same person, but a decision by the owner, a former lawyer, to transfer the property to a private limited company, meant the previous HMO licence ceased to have effect. The owner did not contact the council during the transfer, and the property then required a new HMO licence application.\n\nREAD MORE:Belfast student accommodation blocks get green-light at City Hall\n\nREAD MORE:Belfast city centre hotel planned for old RUC barracks gets council green light for second time\n\nThe council licensing report on the application states: “The property had the benefit of an HMO licence issued by the council on the May 11 2020 to Mr. Hugh Curran and Ms. Bridget Mulholland with an expiry date of May 11 2025.\n\n“In February 2021 the ownership of the property was transferred to Torrbeg Properties Limited and in accordance with section 28 of the 2016 Act the licence ceased to have effect on the date of transfer. The NIHMO Unit was not informed of the change of ownership at that time. An application for a new HMO licence was received from Torrbeg Properties Limited on August 2 2024.”\n\nThe council received a communication from Mr Curran stating: “On or about 1990 I purchased the dwelling 10 Sandymount Street. Since the date of purchasing, the premises have been let in multiple occupation, managed in compliance with all relevant planning and regulatory controls, and in absence of any adverse notices.\n\n“In 2007 I retired from legal practice, and in 2019 in consultation with my accountant I was advised to transfer the premises to a private limited company. In February 2020 Torrbeg Properties Ltd was incorporated, with my wife Anne and I appointed the sole shareholders and directors, and the premises were transferred to the company in 2023.”\n\n Houses of Multiple Occupation, or HMOs, which landlords lease out to three or more tenants from different addresses, have become increasingly controversial, with some arguing they have negatively affected communities and led to anti-social behaviour, in places like the Holyland and Stranmillis in South Belfast where landlords rent houses to undergraduates. \n\n Applications for new HMO licences have increased in other parts of the city in recent months, notably in North Belfast, and have been consistently rejected by councillors in this part of the city. Licences are issued for five year periods. \n\nHMO licence renewal cannot be refused on the basis of overprovision of such properties in an area, but new licences can be refused on this basis.\n\nWhile the council policy is that HMOs should not account for more than 20 percent of any area of housing management, in reality many streets greatly exceed this, with some in the Holyland reaching over 90 percent. Outside housing policy areas the threshold is 10 percent.\n\nAs of October 17 2024, 76 percent of all dwelling units in policy area Sandymount was made up of HMOs and intensive forms of accommodation flats/apartments, which in turn exceeds the 20 percent development limit as set out at policy. There are 109, that is 64 percent licensed HMOs, with a capacity of 469 persons in the area.\n\nOn that date, out of 80 premises available for rent within the BT9 area on the website PropertyNews.com, there were 18 licensed HMOs containing 69 bedspaces. The HMO accommodation was available immediately.\n\nThe council said in its report: “The council recognises that there is a need for intensive forms of housing and to meet this demand, HMOs are an important component of this housing provision.\n\n“HMOs, alongside other accommodation options within the private rented sector, play an important role in meeting the housing needs of people who are single, who have temporary employment, students, low-income households and, more recently, migrant workers.\n\n“In September 2017 the Housing Executive published the document 'Housing Market Analysis Update – Belfast City Council Area' which states 'HMOs form an important element of the PRS, particularly for younger people on low incomes and for single people, under the age of 35, affected by the limitation of housing benefit to the shared room rate. Anecdotal evidence also indicates that this has been a popular sector with migrant workers'.”\n\nIt added: “Ulster University Director of Campus Life told members of the Council’s City Growth and Regeneration Committee that there was an 'increase in competition for HMO’s particularly from NIHE, Immigration Services and statutory agencies and there were increasing accommodation issues across the housing sector which required a holistic view and should include the consideration of international students, families and graduates looking for professional accommodation'.\n\n“However, QUB Director of Student Plus confirmed to members that the current trend indicated a significant move of students to purpose-built student accommodation blocks.”\n\nIt states: “With the continued expansion of the purpose-built student accommodation sector and students transitioning from private rentals to PBMSAs, it is too early to tell whether the increased competition from nonstudents for HMOs is a temporary problem (which can be managed by the contraction in students residing in existing HMO accommodation within the locality) or evidence of an emerging long-term supply issue.”\n\nFor all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.",

        "summary": "Days after decommitting from USC, Julian Lewis, the No. 2 QB in the class,  has picked the Buffs. It's a big boost for Sanders and Colorado.",
        "text": "Five-star quarterback Julian Lewis, the No. 2 recruit in the 2025 ESPN 300, announced his commitment to Deion Sanders and the Colorado Buffaloes on Thursday's episode of \"The Pat McAfee Show.\"\n\nLewis, who had been committed to USC since August 2023, decommitted from Lincoln Riley's class Sunday. Lewis, from Carrollton, Georgia, had recently been on an unofficial visit to Georgia and showed interest in Indiana.\n\nUltimately, it was Sanders & Co. who pulled off another recruiting coup. While at Jackson State, Sanders flipped five-star cornerback/wide receiver Travis Hunter from Florida State in the class of 2022 and did it again the next cycle, getting cornerback Cormani McClain from Miami. Now, with Shedeur Sanders, Deion's son, off to the NFL after this season, the Buffaloes have their QB of the future.\n\nOriginally the top recruit in the class of 2026, Lewis reclassified to the 2025 class in January, but he has been regarded as a top recruit since he was in the eighth grade. Lewis, who is 6-foot-1, 195 pounds, is the second-ranked QB in the class behind Bryce Underwood, an LSU commit.\n\nHere's what to know about this big recruiting news with under two weeks until the early signing period begins on Dec. 4:\n\nHow good is Lewis and who does he compare to in college football?\n\nPerhaps the most important components to this commitment are the timing of the portal period opening combined with Colorado's success on the field. That could prompt higher-profile, better players to want to go to Colorado, which in turn would give Lewis a better supporting cast as many of the top targets on offense are departing this team.\n\nAs far as how Lewis will perform, expect to see more timing and decisiveness from Lewis in offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur's offense. Lewis is a rhythm and timing passer with comparable athletic traits to Shedeur Sanders but is maybe not as resourceful when things break down. Lewis is at his best anticipating and getting the ball out of his hand. He's a right-handed version of Oregon QB Dillon Gabriel. -- Tom Luginbill\n\nWhat does this mean for Deion's future at Colorado?\n\nOn its own, one commitment from a high school player -- however well-regarded he is -- isn't going to impact Sanders' career path in the slightest.\n\nThe takeaway here is more about Sanders and his staff's ability to instill confidence in a player of Lewis' caliber that he will be around -- and that's important. It is unlikely Sanders will ever be able to fully escape speculation about his career, so it's natural for recruiting targets to want reassurances related to that. In this case, Lewis was comfortable enough with what he heard about Sanders' future to commit.\n\nBut it's also important to understand that if Sanders' circumstances change and he leaves for whatever reason, players are free to transfer without penalty. That dynamic lowers the stakes of any commitment in this era.\n\nSanders has said publicly on several occasions -- including this week -- that he is happy in Boulder and has no plans to leave. There is no reason to question his happiness at Colorado, but it would also be misguided to take any coach's comments about their future at face value. -- Kyle Bonagura\n\nWhat's next for Colorado's class?\n\nLewis is only Colorado's fifth ESPN 300 commitment over the past two cycles. But none looms larger than this one, both for what Lewis could represent for the future and what his pledge could mean for the rest of the program's 2025 class, with the Buffaloes making late-cycle noise.\n\nPrior to Lewis' commitment, Colorado had 10 pledges in the 2025 class, all outside the ESPN 300. Sanders landed the top two members of that group when he flipped UCF defensive tackle pledge Christian Hudson and Arizona State wide receiver commit Adrian Wilson in the span of 48 hours late last month. But Colorado has been hunting for flips recently, and Lewis' commitment should trigger some serious recruiting momentum.\n\nThere's growing optimism around the program's chances with Ohio State defensive end pledge London Merritt (No. 52 in the ESPN 300) and outside linebacker Nathaniel Owusu-Boateng (No. 81) after the pair of IMG Academy teammates visited Colorado last week. The Buffaloes hosted two more IMG teammates -- four-star Alabama offensive guard pledge Michael Carroll and three-star Oklahoma State defensive end commit Alexander McPherson -- in Week 12, as well. Meanwhile, top-300 offensive tackle Carde Smith reopened his recruitment Wednesday night when he decommitted from USC after three-plus months in the Trojans' class.\n\nWith Lewis in the fold, the stage is set for Colorado to finish strong in 2025. -- Eli Lederman\n\nWhat's next for the schools that missed out?\n\nUSC rebounded quickly from Lewis' exit, securing the flip of four-star Texas A&M pledge Husan Longstreet on Nov. 17, minutes after Lewis' decommitment became official. Expect the Trojans to stay active in looking for offensive linemen following Smith's decommitment, and USC could still add a major pledge on defense on Dec. 4 as one of four finalists for five-star defensive end Jahkeem Stewart, No. 11 in the ESPN 300.\n\nGeorgia remains the favorite to land five-star defensive tackle Justus Terry (No. 5 in the ESPN 300) and continues to pursue flips of top-300 defenders Tavion Wallace (Arkansas pledge) and Christian Gass (Tennessee). Perhaps most interesting, however, is the Bulldogs' chase for a second quarterback pledge in 2025. Despite a commitment from four-star passer Ryan Montgomery (No. 115 in the ESPN 300), Georgia hosted Lewis in last weekend and plans to host Cal quarterback commit Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele on Nov. 30, while the Bulldogs have also offered Mississippi State pledge KaMario Taylor and Stanford commit Bear Bachmeier in recent weeks.\n\nIndiana's work on the high school recruiting trail should be close to finished. The Hoosiers are up 22 pledges in the 2025 class after they pulled ESPN 300 Byron Baldwin (No. 267) back into their class on Friday following his October decommitment. Coach Curt Cignetti filled his 2024 roster with one-year transfers, so expect Indiana to be active in the portal period, particularly in pursuing quarterbacks with Kurtis Rourke out of eligibility beyond this fall. -- Lederman",

They were not forced to recite their lines from memory, but they seemed to barely need the cue cards they were given to perform the scene.\n\nI, as well as everyone watching based on the comments section, was transported right back to 2004 as Lacey Chabert, as Gretchen Weiner, explained the rules of being a Plastic, which includes only wearing a ponytail one day a week. Cohen’s interpretation of Regina George may have been a lot hammier than Rachel McAdams, but Chabert and Lohan had basically the exact same inflection in their voices as in the original. Everyone stayed pretty professional until the last line, when Chabert exclaimed, “That’s just like, the rules of feminism!” At which point, all three burst out laughing.\n\nIf this is as close to a reboot of the original film as we get, I’m happy with it.",

        "text": "Ashley Cain has announced the exciting news that he is set to become a dad again. In January this year, the Ex On The Beach star announced he and his partner had welcomed a baby boy, two years after the heartbreaking death of his daughter, Azaylia.\n\nAt the time, the 34-year-old announced he and an old friend were expecting a son after his split from ex-partner Safiyya Vorajee, reports the Mirror.\n\nThe former footballer and Safiyya welcomed Azaylia into the world in August 2020 but the pair were left distraught when she was diagnosed with leukaemia just eight weeks later. Now, Ashley and his partner are expecting a second child - less than a year after his son came into the world. \n\nTaking to social media to announce the sweet news, the proud dad posed alongside his son Aliyas as he held up an ultrasound scan in front of the tot. Alongside the picture, Ashley penned: \"Another One\" - DJ Khaled Voice. My little girl will soon have another little brother to watch over, and my little boy will not only be a baby brother, but a big brother too.\n\n\"With all the heartache I've been through, I'm truly grateful that I can really start counting my blessings again. Now it's time to head to two of the most dangerous places in the world to film the final two episodes of my brand new series. \n\n\"So for now, I'm sad to say goodbye, but I look forward to seeing you both soon, my little men. And to my guardian angel, I'll never ever be without you because I can feel your presence in every step I take.\"\n\nAshley finished the post by adding: \"Life has a way of throwing challenges our way, but it also blesses us with moments that fill our hearts with immense joy. Here's to the journey ahead and the beautiful souls who make it worthwhile.\"\n\nLast year, after welcoming the little one with an unnamed childhood friend, Ashley took to his Instagram page to share the happy news of the birth. Along with an adorable snap of their baby, he said: \"Aliyas Diamond Cain - 16.01.24, 4:32am, 9lbs 3oz. I will love you, appreciate you, guide you and protect you with all of my heart, for the rest of my life.\n\n\"And you will have the most beautiful guardian angel heaven holds watching over you and protecting you too. Welcome to the world my son. May your body be strong, your mind be wise, your heart be loving and your spirit be pure and truly powerful.\"\n\nSpeaking previously to The Mirror about the death of his first child, Azaylia, Ashley said his little girl \"saved his life\". He said: \"The reason also why I still talk about her passing is because I am so grateful that even though now I have lost her, I was blessed to have those eight months with her, and in that time, she taught me so much.\n\n\"She changed my life and she continually saves my life. I feel like she gave me a chance at redemption and that she is the person who allowed me to be organically and authentically who I am.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

But what’s been truly remarkable about watching her evolve over the course of this last year isn’t just that her voice and artistry have continued to resonate so widely. It’s that she’s blossomed as bravely and honestly as she has — on her own terms, in her own way.”\n\nPrevious winners include Lil Baby in 2020; The Weeknd in 2021; Bad Bunny in 2022; and Taylor Swift in 2023.",

        "text": "Gautam Adani, the Indian business magnate, faces serious bribery accusations from U.S. authorities. These claims have sent shockwaves through his vast corporate empire.\n\nThe allegations suggest Adani orchestrated a large-scale bribery scheme to secure solar energy contracts in India. The stock market reacted swiftly to the news.\n\nAdani Group companies saw their shares plummet, with the flagship Adani Enterprises dropping over 23%. The group’s market value reportedly fell by $31 billion in a single day.\n\nAdani’s personal fortune also took a hit, shrinking by an estimated $12 billion. The Adani Group is a diverse conglomerate with interests in coal mining, airports, and media.\n\nIts rapid expansion has drawn both praise and scrutiny. Critics have long questioned the source of its meteoric growth. Adani’s close ties to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been a point of contention.\n\nThe latest allegations have reignited this debate in Indian political circles. Opposition leaders are calling for a thorough investigation, while the ruling party defends its position.\n\nLegal and Political Implications\n\nThe U.S. indictment accuses Adani, his nephew, and other executives of multiple fraud-related charges. These include wire fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit fraud.\n\nThe alleged scheme reportedly involved $265 million in bribes to Indian officials. This case highlights the complex interplay between business and politics.\n\nIt raises questions about corporate governance and regulatory oversight in rapidly growing economies. The outcome could have far-reaching consequences for India’s economy and global reputation.\n\nAs the legal process unfolds, investors, politicians, and the public are watching closely. The situation serves as a reminder of the need for transparency and accountability in both business and politics.\n\nThe concept of lawfare also comes into play here. It refers to using legal systems to achieve political goals. While the Adani case is still developing, similar situations have occurred globally, with political figures often claiming legal challenges against them are politically motivated.",

        "title": "World Update: Donald Trump is already reshaping the prospects of Ukraine and Palestinians",
        "summary": "At present in global affairs, all roads lead to Donald Trump.",
        "text": "In an ever-more uncertain world, one thing you can say with a degree of confidence is that, right now in global affairs, all roads lead to Donald Trump. Trump’s re-election to the US presidency – while widely anticipated (especially by the bookmakers) – has kicked off something of a chain reaction.\n\nWhether it’s his track record in his first term in office from 2017 to 2021, comments he made on the campaign trail, comments he has made since the election, his cabinet picks or comments his cabinet picks have made, the prospect of Trump assuming arguably the most powerful office in world politics in just a few weeks time is making its own weather around the globe.\n\nIn Ukraine, where the war has just passed its 1,000th day and Russia continued to advance slowly but steadily, the prospect that next year will see a ceasefire brokered by the Trump administration, followed by negotiations at which Vladimir Putin would hold many of the cards, looks to be the new reality. \n\nThe idea, cherished by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, that Ukraine’s defenders would be able to force Russian troops back beyond the borders as established at the end of the cold war in 1991 – a notion in which he was wholeheartedly supported by his western allies – now appears to be a non-starter. All indications point to a frozen conflict, with each side holding the territory it now occupies (although one can imagine Ukraine will have more of a problem holding on to the 600 or so square kilometres of Russian soil it presently controls in the Kursk region).\n\nNow, more than ever, it’s vital to be informed about the important issues affecting global stability. Sign up to receive our weekly World Affairs briefing from the UK newsletter. Every Thursday we’ll you expert analysis of the big stories making international headlines.\n\nBut, of course, there was already a frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine after Russia’s incursions in 2014. And – as Stefan Wolff, an international security expert from the University of Birmingham, points out – the Minsk accords on Ukraine of September 2014 and February 2015, which were supposed to maintain some degree, at least, of security and stop the fighting in the region turned out not to be worth the paper they were written on.\n\nThere’s very little chance that Trump will allow US troops to be sent to Ukraine as peacekeepers or combatants. So, Wolff surmises, it’ll be down to Europe to step up. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said as much before the US election and Margus Tsahkna, Estonia’s foreign minister, has explicitly said this week that Europe must be prepared to underpin a peace deal.\n\nEurope must ensure it is intimately involved in any peace negotiations, Wolff concludes: “In negotiations involving Trump, Putin and Zelensky alone, Ukraine would be the weakest link and European interests would probably be completely ignored… After 1,000 days of the most devastating military confrontation on European soil since the second world war, it is time to accept that nothing about Europe should be without Europe.”\n\n Read more:\n Ukraine: after 1,000 days of war, Europe must prepare for a Trump-brokered peace deal by asserting its own interests\n\nAs you might expect, Trump’s victory has also been focusing the mind of the man who is currently sitting behind the Resolute desk. And on day 998 of the conflict, Joe Biden, gave Zelensky the go-ahead to use US-supplied long-range Atacms (army tactical missile system) against targets inside Russia, something the Ukrainian president has been begging for over pretty much the duration of the war.\n\nUkraine immediately took Biden at his word, launching eight missiles at targets in Bryansk, a Russian region bordering Ukraine. The following day the UK government formally signed off on Ukraine using its Storm Shadow long-range missiles in the same way, and Ukraine used them to attack targets in the Kursk region. \n\nMany commentators believe that one of the epitaphs for Biden’s handling of the war in Ukraine will be too little, too late. This week he also gave permission for Ukraine to deploy anti-personnel mines (APLs) in Ukraine, of the sort that are shunned by 164 countries that are signatories to the Ottawa convention banning such ordnance. Which, of course, means he might have another epitaph as the US leader willing to use weapons almost universally condemned as a horrific scourge “already contaminating more than 70 countries”.\n\nIt’s worth noting, though, that neither the US nor Russia is a signatory to the convention. Ukraine is – but that hasn’t prevented it becoming one of the most mine-contaminated countries in the world.\n\nThe reason that Ukraine is so keen to get their hands on these APLs, writes David Galbreath of the University of Bath, an expert in military technology, is that it needs to find a way to stall Russian infantry as they continue to advance. \n\nGalbreath describes how the success of Ukrainian drones at targeting Russian armoured vehicles had forced the Russians to change tactics and advance on foot. Ukraine had been finding their anti-tank weapons ineffective for forcing enemy infantry into their lines of fire, hence the need for anti-personnel mines, no matter how dirty a weapon they might be.\n\n Read more:\n US decision to supply Kyiv with hated anti-personnel mines is both controversial and a depressing sign of the way the war is going\n\nOn Putin’s side of the ledger, meanwhile, the main issue is that Russia’s advantage in the field has always depended on the asymmetric advantage provided by the imbalance in troops numbers. Put simply, the Russian military has always been able to call on more bodies to throw into battle than Ukraine.\n\nBut there are suggestions that Putin’s reservoir of manpower might be shallower than he’d like. His decision to deploy North Korean troops in the Kursk region, the emptying of prisons to send convicts to the frontline and, more recently, the recruitment and training of troops from the occupied parts of Ukraine all hint that filling Russia’s quota of 20,000 new troops each month has not been plain sailing.\n\nNatasha Lindsteadt, an expert in authoritarian regimes from the University of Essex, gives us an in-depth look at how Russia fills its ranks. She surmises that, just quietly, Putin might be as keen as Donald Trump to bring this conflict to a speedy conclusion: as long as it favours his side, of course. Because Putin is quickly running out of people he can send to the front lines.\n\n Read more:\n Russia needs a peace deal soon as it is running out of soldiers\n\nThe view from Israel\n\nBack in Washington, Trump’s senior foreign policy choices are coming in for a degree of bemused scrutiny. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will be considerably buoyed by the news that Trump wants former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as his ambassador to Israel. \n\nHuckabee, whose CV also acknowledges his stint as a talk-show host, an evangelical Baptist minister and contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016 (when Huckabee called the president-elect a “car wreck”), is known for his outspoken views on Palestine. Namely that it doesn’t exist.\n\nHuckabee is on the record for saying, after witnessing the inauguration of n illegal settlement on the West Bank, that: “There is no such thing as a West Bank. It’s Judea and Samaria [the territory’s biblical name]. There’s no such thing as a settlement. They’re communities, they’re neighbourhoods, they’re cities. There’s no such thing as an occupation.”\n\nClive Jones, a professor of regional security at Durham University with a particular interest in the Middle East, believes that Trump could take the brakes off Israel’s campaign in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon and even against Iran.\n\nWhile Joe Biden has maintained steadfast support for Israel and the government of its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, he has privately urged caution. He recently attempted to put a deadline on Israel ensuring more food and humanitarian supplies get into Gaza where people are starving.\n\nBut, as Jones notes here, Trump’s pick for secretary of state, Marco Rubio, while mainly known as a China hawk, is on the record as being against a ceasefire in Gaza. He told journalists recently that: “I want them [Israel] to destroy every element of Hamas they can get their hands on. These people are vicious animals who did horrifying crimes.”\n\nWith elements of Netanyhu’s government urging the annexation of the West Bank and signs that they might also have designs on northern Gaza and a US administration that looks set to back Israel to the hilt, things are looking bleak for the Palestinian people, concludes Jones.\n\n Read more:\n Gaza: outlook for Palestinians bleak under a Trump presidency that looks set to go 'all the way' with Netanyahu\n\nThere has been a major personnel change in Netanyahu’s cabinet, too. Earlier this month he unceremoniously dumped his defence minister, Yoav Gallant. If Biden attempted to be a brake on Netanyahu from the White House, perhaps Gallant was the nearest thing to someone attempting to moderate the behaviour of the prime minister from within his own government.\n\nGallant has long called for a ceasefire and a hostage deal. He also wanted universal conscription and an end to the exemption of ultra-Orthodox men from military service. And, perhaps, most significantly, his was a strong voice calling for an immediate state inquiry into the causes of the October 7 Hamas-led attacks – something his critics say he is desperate to avoid.\n\nJohn Strawson, of the University of East London, who writes regularly about Israeli politics here, believes that Netanyahu might act against other powerful military voices in the weeks to come. He believes that the Israeli prime minister is “to reshape Israel in his own political image. That means not only diminishing the role of the judiciary, but also undermining the influence of the IDF and the security establishment.”\n\nIn what appears a sinister corollary to Gallant’s dismissal and the appointment of Huckabee as US ambassador to Israel, Netanyahu has nominated a far-right firebrand, Yechiel Leiter, as the new Israeli ambassador to Washington. Leichter, who came up via the now outlawed Kahanist movement in the US, is known to favour annexation of the West Bank.\n\nHe’ll soon be back in America sharing his vision with the Trump administration. \n\n Read more:\n Israel: Yoav Gallant's sacking could have devastating consequences both for Palestinians and Israelis\n\nWorld affairs briefing, from the UK\nis available as a weekly email newsletter.

        "text": "Essex Police said in a statement that the force \"has reviewed this case, having sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service. They have advised that no charges should be brought.

That’s why we work so hard to remain impartial and to investigate allegations, regardless of where they might lead.\"\n\nPearson publicised the visit from police after she penned an article in which she claimed she was told by the police who came to her home it was over a “non-crime hate incident”, but not told which post it was about.\n\nThe force said body cam footage of the incident showed that “at no stage” did its officers tell her the report being investigated was being treated as a “non-crime hate incident\".\n\nA non-crime hate incident is where no criminal offence has been committed but the person reporting it believes the incident to be motivated by hostility.\n\nThe BBC has seen the now-deleted post the police complaint related to.\n\nIt dates from 16 November 2023 and shows an image of two police officers standing next to two men holding what appears to be a flag of the Pakistani political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).\n\nThe post tags the Metropolitan Police alongside the words “how dare they”.\n\nIt adds: “Invited to pose for a photo with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday police refused.

        "text": "The family of a solicitor who tragically lost her life alongside her beloved dog have issued a moving tribute to their 'intelligent, kind and caring' wife and daughter.\n\nEmily Thornton-Sandy, 30, passed away on November 11, six days after being involved in a serious road traffic collision whilst bringing her dog Scout home from the local vet.\n\nThe accident occurred on a stretch of the A48 between Cross Hands and Pont Abraham on Tuesday, November 5. \n\nAccording to Dyfed-Powys Police, Scout passed away shortly after the collision, with Emily rushed to the University Hospital of Wales with severe injuries which she ultimately succumbed to a number of days later.\n\nRemembering Emily, the 30-year-old's family released their statement through local police in which her husband spoke of his inconceivable grief.\n\n'This still feels unreal and none of us can take it in. Emily was kind, compassionate, and had so much more to give. \n\n'She used her intelligence in her work as a solicitor, where she strove to help others affected by industrial disease. \n\n'Emily loved literature and was passionate about her house plants. Her passing has left a hole in our lives which can never be filled. I wake up every morning in disbelief at the fact that I will never see her smile again.\n\n'Emily deserved a long and happy life, and the thought of what happened to her that day brings the greatest pain to all those who love her.\n\n'Scout was the most gentle, affectionate dog you could ever meet, and I have not been able to grieve for her death as I should. She brought great happiness to both me and Emily and the world has lost so much joy.\n\n'I wish to thank all emergency services staff and persons at the scene for all the help they provided to Emily and Scout, and to the staff at University Hospital of Wales for doing everything they could for Emily in the days following the collision'.\n\nEmily's parents added: 'The loss of Emily, our only child, is devastating. She meant the absolute world to us, and our lives have been changed forever. Not only have we lost our baby girl, but we mourn the loss of the grandchildren that we will never have.\n\n'Emily has always been our pride and joy and she achieved so much during her short life.

        "text": "President-elect Donald Trump began picking members of his Cabinet right after winning the election, and almost immediately his choices courted lots of criticism — chief among them the fact that most of them don’t seem to have any actual experience for the positions in which they’ve been placed.\n\nAlso, the irony isn’t lost on folks that a man whose platform seems to be staunchly anti-DEI appointed a bunch of folks who feel pretty...DEI. From Fox News hosts to alleged sexual predators to a WWE executive, here are Trump’s rather questionable Cabinet picks to date.\n\nTulsi Gabbard, Director of National Intelligence\n\nTrump selected former Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who routinely amplifies Russian propaganda and conspiracy theories, as the Director of National Intelligence. In the position, her role would have her oversee 18 intelligence agencies, but folks in the House Intelligence Committee are worried about what she’ll do considering her affinity for foreign dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nEducation Secretary, Linda McMahon\n\nFormer wrestling executive Linda McMahon served as Trump’s Small Business Administration head during his first presidential term. As one of his top allies, McMahon will run the Department of Education — despite barely having any education experience: In 2009, she served on the Connecticut Board of Education for just one year.\n\nSecretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth\n\nThe closest experience former Fox News host Pete Hegseth has in defending anything is shielding himself from sexual assault allegations — yet Trump picked him as Secretary of Defense. In 2020, Hegseth reached a settlement agreement with the accuser to protect his job. He has also been involved in a far-right extremism scandal stemming from his tattoos that led to his removal from a National Guard assignment. The host claimed they were a symbol of Christianity.\n\nFederal Communications Commission Administrator, Brendan Carr\n\nTrump selected Brendan Carr to head the Federal Communications Commission. Carr, who is the senior Republican commissioner at the FCC, actually authored a chapter of Project 2025. In the document, he wrote that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act—which grants immunity to tech companies that moderate user-generated content—should be stripped to end content moderation that some conservatives regard as censorship. Trump once called Carr a “warrior for Free Speech.”\n\nAdministrator Of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz, former surgeon turned TV host, will lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). If his nomination is confirmed by the Senate, Oz would oversee Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. According to federal data, at least 145 million Americans are enrolled under one of the three programs. Oz has said he supports an option that could lead to more Medicare privatization. \n\nAdministrator For Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk\n\nX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been tasked with overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency. Interestingly, Musk has a long history of problems with government regulatory agencies and outstanding unresolved investigations, including a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into inside stock trading. \n\nAdministrator For Department of Government Efficiency, Vivek Ramaswamy\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who previously challenged Trump in the Republican presidential primary before endorsing him in January, made reducing waste in government spending a vital policy platform for his campaign. Now, he —alongside Elon Musk — will be heading the Department of Government Efficiency. \n\nU.S. Ambassador To Israel, Mike Huckabee\n\nTrump has selected the former governor of Arkansas and right-wing Christian Zionist, Mike Huckabee, as his U.S. Ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is also a conservative television personality who would become the first non-Jewish U.S. ambassador in 16 years. He will likely unconditionally support the Israeli government in expansionism.\n\nSecretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy\n\nFormer reality TV star and Fox Business host Sean Duffy was selected as Trump’s Secretary of Transportation. Duffy was a notable loyalist in Congress during Trump’s first term. Duffy first appeared on television in 1997 as a cast member on MTV’s “The Real World.” He also served as a congressman from Wisconsin’s 7th congressional district from 2011 to 2019. \n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Secretary of Health and Human Services\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr. has been nominated as Secretary of Health and Human Services, despite saying that vaccines cause autism. He is a decades-long heroin addict and self-confessed sex addict who has been accused of numerous sexual assaults. He was also reportedly involved in an affair with Olivia Nuzzi, a writer for New York Magazine, which led to the loss of her fiancee and job. \n\nSecretary Of State, Marco Rubio\n\n Senator Marco Rubio being Trump’s pick for Secretary of State seems like one of the President-elect’s more conventional choices. Rubio is a veteran politician who served on the foreign relations and intelligence committees for over a decade. However, when he ran against Trump in 2016, Rubio labeled his opponent as a con artist who possesses a dangerous leadership style. \n\nU.N. Ambassador, Elise Stefanik\n\nTrump has offered the job of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations to Rep. Elise Stefanik, though she called the UN a “den of antisemitism” that she intends to confront in a recent speech posted on her website. Stefanik has also said that the UN has “continuously betrayed Israel and betrayed America” and acted as “an apologist for Iran.”\n\nU.S. Ambassador To NATO, Matthew Whitaker\n\nDonald Trump has selected Matthew Whitaker, who literally has no foreign policy experience, to represent America’s best interests as his ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Whitaker served as acting attorney general during Trump’s first term.",

        "text": "Hardline Republican Matt Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration as president-elect Donald Trump’s attorney general, in the face of opposition from the Senate Republicans whose support he would have needed to win the job.\nGaetz, who resigned from the US House of Representatives last week, was the subject of an Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of having sex with a 17-year-old girl. He has denied wrongdoing.\n“There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I’ll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General,” Gaetz wrote in a post on X. “Trump’s DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.”\n\nGaetz, who was nominated last week, faced questions over his qualifications to serve as the country’s top police official and his past conduct. He was investigated by the Justice Department for nearly three years into potential sex trafficking violations, an inquiry that ended last year without charges being brought.\nSome Republican senators expressed misgivings about his nomination, though none had said publicly they would outright oppose him.\nRepublican Senator Cynthia Lummis said Gaetz’s decision would give Trump the opportunity to nominate an attorney general “with fewer headwinds in the Senate”.\nGaetz’s withdrawal is a blow to Trump’s push to install steadfast loyalists in his incoming administration and the first sign that Trump could face resistance from members of his own party.\nWriting on his Truth Social network, Trump praised Gaetz for stepping aside to avoid being a “distraction” for his new administration, adding: “Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do!”\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press, Agence France-Presse",

UK-made Storm Shadow cruise missiles were used by Ukraine for the first time against Russia. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow has the right to strike military targets of countries whose weapons are used by Ukraine to hit Russian territory. A veiled warning to London and Washington.Russia's NATO Expansion NarrativeRussia sees NATO's eastward expansion as a threat to its security and a violation of a so-called promise the US made to the USSR that the military alliance would not move further east in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to Germany's incorporation into NATO in 1990 and then US Secretary of State, James Baker, had told Gorbachev that it would not move beyond the inner German border, but Washington retreated from its position, a report from Chatham House said. One of the basis of the claim is then-German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher's speech in 1990, where he said, \"No matter what happens in the Warsaw Pact countries, there will be no expansion of NATO territory to the east, that is, closer to the borders of the Soviet Union.\" This was made before the collapse of the USSR and the creation of independent nations in Eastern Europe.Even Gorbachev in some interviews agreed about the existence of the verbal \"agreement\" but also refuted it in some. The narrative has been actively used by the Russians to justify actions in Ukraine, claiming that the US has moved further, threatening national security.But, in 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron, at the 2018 St Petersburg International Economic Forum, said \"I think that the mistake that was made in the last 20 years was that we in NATO failed to fully comply with all the obligations we had taken on, and this caused certain fears, quite reasonable ones. And we did not have the trust that Russia rightfully expected.\"After the Russia-Ukraine war, many scholars have argued that the expansion of NATO has been a trigger to the war.&nbsp",

These days it’s still all about those enticements but with K-pop culture the huge and newer drawcard, from the tribute murals around YG Entertainment and themed bears lining Gangnam’s K-Star Road to the K-star cafes owned by the pop idols themselves. See visitseoul.net\n\nChawton, England\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that we all love a good Jane Austen occasion – and the 250th anniversary of her birth (December 16, 1775) will give Austen fans plenty of reason to head to Old Blighty next year. Jane Austen’s House in Chawton, a village in Hampshire where the author spent her final years, plans to host a year-long celebration. It kicks off with expanding its Pride and Prejudice Day into a Pride and Prejudice Festival (January 23-28). Events will include a sewing circle, writing sessions, piano practice, themed tours, pop-up talks, a quiz, book club and late viewing sessions. From May 1 to May 11 there’s a Sense and Sensibility Festival, and more throughout the year, culminating in a Birthday Celebration Week (December 13-21).

In 2025, get to know the northernmost Hawaiian island’s Old Koloa Town – a historic sugarcane area tucked into the hinterland behind Poipu’s beach resorts (where you might spy monk seals lazing on the sand). Koloa, which opened its first sugar mill in 1835, is marking not only its 190th birthday but the 40th anniversary of its annual festival, Koloa Plantation Days.

This settlement is the home of Burnham Beeches, a three-storey art deco mansion with a fascinating history – and future. Built in 1933 as a home for a wealthy industrialist, over the decades it’s been a research facility, children’s hospital and a canvas for a ground-breaking immersive installation by Melbourne artist Rone. Now it’s set to become a luxurious 43-room Six Senses hotel. Global firm Woods Bagot is the lead architect for the brand’s debut in Australia and there are hopes that construction will begin in December. Originally slated for a mid-2025 opening, let’s watch this space.

Founder and patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, says these games will “expand the range of winter adaptive sports” to include new events such as alpine skiing and snowboarding, Nordic skiing and biathlon, skeleton and wheelchair curling. These Games, which will also showcase its core sports of indoor rowing, sitting volleyball, swimming, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball, will be held in partnership with Indigenous communities.

In the West Australian Mid West wheat-belt town of Carnamah (population 400), what’s said to be the world’s biggest tractor was unveiled in October. The Big Tractor, a five-times replica of the Chamberlain 40K that’s played an integral role in the state’s history, stands at 11.5 metres tall and is hard to miss (it’s bright orange). The tractors were produced in Perth from 1949 until the 1980s. Carnamah, about 300 kilometres north of Perth, loves a good tractor – it’s also home to Walton’s Tractor Museum where you can see dozens of working vintage John Deere and Chamberlain tractors. With Carnamah situated in Wildflower Country, get busy planning a visit for next spring.

Jane Austen’s House in Chawton, a village in Hampshire where the author spent her final years, plans to host a year-long celebration.

To meet the goal, Pony will sell as many as 20 million American depository shares. \n\nThat’s still down from the much higher target of $425 million, which Pony was aiming for earlier this year before its board approved a reduction of its minimum valuation from around $8 billion to $4 billion. \n\nOther deals that got my attention …\n\nAmple, the San Francisco-based EV battery-swapping company, raised $25 million from new investor Mitsubishi Corporation. \n\nClass8, a Toronto-based trucking fleet operations startup previously called FleetOps, raised $22 million in a Series A round led by Xplorer Capital.

The all-equity round also included participation from Micelio Mobility, Naval Ravikant, Java Capital, Samarthya Investment Advisors, Redstart (from Naukri), and Anicut. The round has valued the startup at $46 million post-money — over 2x its previous $21 million valuation.\n\nFlipturn, a New York-based startup that developed software to help fleets manage their EV charging, raised $11 million in a Series A round led by CRV with participation from Accel.\n\nNotable reads and other tidbits\n\nAutonomous vehicles\n\nCruise admitted to submitting a false report with the goal of influencing a federal investigation into a safety incident last year. The GM subsidiary agreed to pay a $500,000 criminal fine as part of a deferred prosecution agreement.\n\nMay Mobility is starting to test driverless shuttles (self-driving Toyota Sienna minivans) in Ann Arbor.\n\nNuro started rolling out a test fleet of its driverless, passenger-less R3 vehicles across the Bay Area and Houston, two months after changing its business strategy to license its AV tech to automakers and mobility providers. The reason? Show potential customers what they’ve got. \n\nXiaodi Hou, the co-founder and former CEO of self-driving trucking startup TuSimple, has urged a California district court to issue a temporary restraining order to stop the company from transferring its remaining U.S. assets to China. This fight is getting messy. \n\nElectric vehicles, charging, & batteries\n\nHyundai revealed the new Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV that is expected to come to the U.S. in the spring of 2025. Read more from contributor Emme Hall about this new EV and its numerous features.\n\nRemember the Ram Ramcharger? Well Stellantis has released new details about STLA Frame, the underlying vehicle platform that the Ram Ramcharger will eventually be built on. TL;DR: This is designed to be a multi-energy platform, which means it can be the foundation for an internal combustion, hybrid, battery-electric, or even gas-extending vehicle like the Ram Ramcharger.\n\nThe $7,500 EV tax credit is on Trump’s chopping block.\n\nIn-car tech\n\nFord agreed to pay a $165 million penalty to federal regulators after moving too slowly to recall vehicles with faulty rearview cameras. \n\nGeneral Motors has cut another 1,000 jobs in the U.S., none of which were hourly workers.

        "text": "In response to rising tensions surrounding the burial of late Senator Patrick Ifeanyi Ubah, Governor of Anambra State, Prof. Charles Soludo, has ordered the closure of schools in Nnewi for a week.\n\nThe decision follows fears of potential violence, with reports of threats from non-state actors to disrupt the event unless certain unresolved issues were addressed. \n\nThe situation escalated further on Wednesday evening when gunmen attacked Nnewi, killing several people and setting a vehicle ablaze. The incident, which occurred around 7:30 p.m., created widespread panic as residents fled for safety.\n\nWith the burial set for Friday November 22nd, 2024 in Umuanuka village, Otolo Nnewi, the state government issued a circular on Thursday directing all schools in the Nnewi zone to shut down until Tuesday next week. Parents were also advised to keep day students at home to ensure their safety.\n\nALSO READ: Church donates relief materials to Anambra flood victims\n\nIn the circular, shared through school WhatsApp groups, school principals were urged to communicate the closure to parents and caution against students wandering in school uniforms during this period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Anambra State Police Command has refuted claims linking the Nnewi attack to the burial. Police spokesperson, Superintendent Tochukwu Ikenga, stated that the attackers were not non-state actors, as speculated. According to Ikenga, the incident was the result of a gunfight between security operatives and a suspect at a checkpoint.\n\nThe exchange of fire reportedly caused a Toyota Venza carrying police officers to catch fire after its fuel tank was hit, injuring two bystanders who are now receiving medical treatment. \n\nIkenga assured the public that the attack was unrelated to the burial, emphasizing that the Joint Security Forces had been deployed to maintain order and protect residents and visitors during the ceremonies.\n\nAuthorities are urging the public to remain calm and await the outcome of ongoing investigations.\n\nREAD MORE FROM: NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\n\n\r\n\r\nGet real-time news updates from Tribune Online!

        "summary": "The folk rock icon said his hearing loss has limited the songs he can perform live",
        "text": "Paul Simon has warned fans they won’t be hearing him play his 1986 hit “You Can Call Me Al” anytime soon.\n\nThe 83-year-old folk rock icon, who rose to fame with Art Garfunkel as the renowned 1960s duo Simon & Garfunkel, joined CBS Mornings on Wednesday (November 20), where he spoke about his hearing loss battle.\n\n“I’m going through my repertoire and reducing a lot of the choices that I make to acoustic versions,” he said on the show. “It’s all much quieter. It’s not ‘You Can Call Me Al.’ That’s gone. I can’t do that one.”\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee started to lose his hearing four years ago during the recording of his 2023 studio album, Seven Psalms. At the time, Simon assumed his performing days were over.\n\nReflecting back on his first few months coping with the reality of losing his hearing, he said: “It was incredibly frustrating. I was very angry at first, y’know, that this had happened.\n\n“I guess what I’m most apprehensive about would be if I can’t hear well enough to really enjoy the act of making music,” he noted.\n\nAccording to Simon, he’s lost 94 percent of his hearing in his left ear. When he initially spoke to his doctors about the hearing loss, they’d claimed nothing could be done to help him. Now, he’s putting his faith in the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss, a team of 100 scientists dedicated to finding methods for hearing loss prevention and repair. Simon is hopeful in the mission.\n\nHe’s also been looking to other artists who’ve gone through similar health issues for inspiration amid the battle.\n\n“You know Matisse, when he was suffering at the end of his life, when he was in bed, he envisioned all these cut-outs and had a great creative period,” Simone said of the 20th century French visual artist. “So I don’t think creativity stops with disability. So far, I haven’t experienced that. And I hope not to.”\n\nThough he won’t play “You Can Call Me Al” again, which Setlist.fm estimates he’s performed over 400 times throughout his career, Simon is “optimistic” he’ll get back to hosting full-length concerts.\n\nLast month, he told The Guardian: “I’m hoping to eventually be able to do a full-length concert. I’m optimistic. Six months ago I was pessimistic.”\n\nSimon’s 2018 “Homeward Bound - The Farewell Tour” began in Vancouver, Canada before finishing up in Queens, New York, just miles away from where he’d gone to school with his long-time music partner, Garfunkel. \n\nLast month, the two reunited for the first time in years, Garfunkel told The Sunday Times in an interview with his son, Art Garfunkel Jr.\n\n“I looked at Paul and said, ‘What happened? Why haven’t we seen each other?’” Garfunkel recalled. “Paul mentioned an old interview where I said some stuff.\n\n“I cried when he told me how much I had hurt him. Looking back, I guess I wanted to shake up the nice guy image of Simon & Garfunkel. Y’know what? I was a fool!”\n\nThe last time Simon & Garfunkel performed together was in 2010, when they took part in the American Film Institute’s (AFI) tribute to The Graduate director Mike Nichols, whose film helped propel them to international fame by featuring a number of their songs.",

        "text": "Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman shocked fans by announcing his separation from his wife Saira Banu after 29 years of marriage. As the news of their split circulates, attention has turned to Rahman's impressive asset value and the potential implications for the couple's divorce proceedings. According to reports, Rahman has an estimated net worth of ₹1,728 crores, making him India's wealthiest musician. He had a prolific career spanning over 145 films across multiple languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and English. The Oscar-winning composer's vast fortune includes luxury properties in Chennai and Los Angeles, a fleet of high-end vehicles, and lucrative music studios across the globe. Reports suggest that Rahman charges approximately ₹3 crore per song and between ₹8-10 crore per film. His live performances fetch him an impressive ₹1-2 crore each. His portfolio is equally impressive. He owns a stunning bungalow in Chennai, featuring multiple bedrooms, an expansive dining area, and a state-of-the-art music studio. The interiors reflect understated luxury and elegance. Additionally, Rahman possesses a luxurious property in Los Angeles, equipped with a modern music studio, catering to his frequent visits to the United States. His high-end automobile collections include a Volvo SUV worth ₹93.87 lakh, a Jaguar priced at ₹1.08 crore, and a Mercedes valued at ₹2.86 crore. His garage also includes a Porsche Taycan EV worth approximately ₹3 crore, showcasing his penchant for luxury automobiles. Rahman's business acumen extends beyond his musical endeavours. He owns AM Musiq Studios, with branches in Mumbai, London, and Los Angeles, further diversifying his income streams and solidifying his global presence in the music industry. As Rahman and Saira Banu navigate their separation, questions naturally arise about potential financial discussions. However, their lawyer, Vandana Shah, has stated that financial matters have not yet been broached. \"Not as yet. It has not come to this stage yet. It would be an amicable divorce,\" Shah commented, emphasizing the couple's commitment to handling their separation with dignity. While the financial aspects of their separation remain undisclosed, Rahman's substantial net worth and diverse asset portfolio will likely be significant factors in any future discussions. However, both parties have expressed a desire for privacy and an amicable resolution to their separation. As one of India's wealthiest musicians, Rahman's divorce proceedings are being closely watched, though both parties have requested privacy during this sensitive time.",

        "summary": "Trump’s administration is expected to ease up on regulating mergers and acquisitions, though it is unclear what exact antitrust cases against Big Tech it will pursue during the president-elect’s term.",
        "text": "Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nThe Biden administration’s regulatory push against Big Tech has reached the eleventh-hour ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming term, targeting deals and mergers sought by high-profile companies as it wraps up four years of strict antitrust enforcement that could potentially be softened by the president-elect.\n\n(Photo by JIM WATSONSAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Justice Department’s case against Google is one of the largest antitrust undertakings in the final days of Biden’s presidency, as the department reportedly plans to request that a judge force Google to sell its Chrome web browser to create a more competitive browser market (Chrome commands a 66.7% market share over other browsers like Safari, Edge and Firefox).\n\nThe case against Google, which was found to have illegally acted as a search monopoly, began under the Trump administration, continued under Biden and is slated to wrap during Trump’s upcoming term, but it’s uncertain what approach the next Trump administration will take.\n\nThe Biden administration is also placing pressure on Hewlett Packard’s $14 billion acquisition of networking technology firm Juniper, with company representatives meeting with regulators as recently as last week to convince the Justice Department to not challenge the deal in court, according to Bloomberg, which noted the companies might delay the deal until Trump’s term in hopes of less regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is planning to probe Microsoft’s cloud computing business for potential anti-competitive practices, the Financial Times reported, with regulators specifically looking into accusations Microsoft is pushing harsh licensing terms to stop customers from transferring their data to competitor platforms.\n\nThe FTC has also set its targets on Amazon, recently suing the e-commerce giant over allegations it warped goods prices across other retail sites by deterring its sellers from discounting items and lowering prices (Amazon has argued its business practices create competition and that FTC interference would result in fewer products, higher prices and slower deliveries).\n\nThe FTC’s lawsuit against Amazon is one of several filed against the company this year, as Amazon has already settled lawsuits over its Alexa virtual assistant and Ring security camera devices, costing the company more than $30 million.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nHow Will The Trump Administration Handle Big Tech?\n\nTrump’s administration, which levied crackdowns on Google and Facebook during his previous presidency, is expected to dial back antitrust pressure in his second term, the Associated Press reported, citing the anticipated departures of FTC Chair Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter, assistant attorney general for antitrust within the Justice Department. The two antitrust enforcement figures have proven strict during their time in office, contributing to the scuttling of several corporate deals worth billions of dollars. Tesla chief Elon Musk, who was named co-chair of the new Department of Government Efficiency and has given his opinion on Cabinet candidates directly to Trump, said in October that Khan would be “fired soon.” Some experts, however, also believe the transition to a new administration is not likely to stop existing antitrust cases from impacting Big Tech, the AP reported, but noted “everyone is betting” the Trump administration will be more receptive to mergers in the future. Cabinet picks such as former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., as attorney general could also shake up the expected approach. The Republican has criticized Big Tech with claims of censorship against conservatives and supported antitrust measures.\n\nTrump nominated Brendan Carr to chair the Federal Communications Commission. The Big Tech critic, who has served as an FCC commissioner since 2017, wrote a chapter in the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda that calls for the FCC to lessen the laws protecting tech companies from liability over content posted to their platforms. Carr has also expressed support for federal laws that would be similar to legislation in Texas and Florida, where penalties are made against social media companies for removing users based on their viewpoints.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"He is certainly in the position to control the DOJ's disposition of the remedies phase,\" former FTC Chair William Kovacic told Reuters, speaking of Trump’s ability to influence the outcome of Google’s antitrust case.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe Biden administration has legally pressed tech’s biggest players since 2020, filing complaints against companies like Meta, Amazon, Apple and Binance that have resulted in costly settlements. In the year ended Sept. 30, 2022, the FTC brought 24 enforcement actions while the Justice Department’s antitrust division brought 26, Bloomberg reported, adding the total number of challenges marked the highest since 1976. The antitrust enforcement brought on by the agencies fell in line with commitments from Khan and Kanter at the start of their terms, with Khan vowing to beef up merger enforcement as she recommended a “hard look” at merger guidelines to “determine whether they are overly permissive.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nJustice Department Will Request Judge Order Google To Sell Chrome In Antitrust Case, Report Says (Forbes)\n\nGoogle Is On The Antitrust Chopping Block, And Trump Probably Won’t Save It (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

        "summary": "Six school staff reported being assaulted every day in Midlothian last year, according to figures released by the council.",
        "text": "More than 1,250 attacks were recorded in Midlothian schools during 190 school days over 2023, ranging from assaults with weapons to biting, physical assaults and things being thrown at them. The shocking figures, revealed by workers union the GMB, are feared to be just the ‘tip of the iceberg’ by their local representative. Midlothian Council said it was committed to tackling the issue and supporting staff and pupils on a daily basis. Figures released by the local authority to the GMB revealed a total of 1,254 assaults were reported last year with 90 per cent taking place in the classrooms themselves. They included 964 physical assaults, six involving a weapon, and 107 involving biting. In 75 cases the staff member was hit with an object while a further 22 were struck by objects thrown at them while 62 reported verbal assaults and the rest were described as ‘other injuries’. John McCartney, the GMB organiser in Midlothian Council, said the figures were ‘shocking; but not surprising. He said: “Violence against staff in our schools is clearly at crisis levels but official records are still underestimating the scale of that crisis. These reports are the tip of the iceberg. “From what our members tell us, the incidents of violence and abuse that are not being reported, recorded or investigated could far outstrip those that are. “No worker should go to their work in fear and feel relief if they arrive home unhurt. No one should be asked to go to their work to be punched, kicked, bit, spat on, and expecting to suffer verbal or physical abuse. “Our members do not feel the authorities are tackling or even recognising the violence in schools but are instead glossing over it and allowing it become normalised.” A Midlothian Council spokesman said the council was committed to supporting its school community. He said: “Policies, processes and training are in place to help staff to prevent incidents from occurring and to de-escalate pupils in distress. When an incident does occur, staff are encouraged to report it to their line manager and record it on the health and safety management system. Incident data is used to review the support packages in place for individual children and across schools.” A national survey of GMB members has revealed two thirds of incidents are never recorded while three out of four victims said they receive no feedback if they do report an incident. The union is piloting a poster campaign to bolster reporting systems with trial in schools in five local authority areas initially and plans to roll it out across the country if successful.",

It's frightening,\" Angelina said at the time), the high schooler has since gravitated toward behind-the-scenes roles. \n\nAngelina said that Vivienne was the one to encourage her to help bring an adaptation of Francis Ford Coppola’s 1983 film The Outsiders to Broadway, so the teen ended up serving as a volunteer assistant to her producer mom on the Tony winner. \n\n“She’ll correct me,\" Angelina told People of Vivienne, who's credited in the playbill as Vivienne Jolie. \"She'll say, 'Didn't you read the memo? We have to do this, we have to go through this,' ” Jolie said. “She’s been a really tough assistant. She takes it very, very seriously.”",

He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect. Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do!”\n\nGaetz’s nomination had run into controversy from the moment after the announcement over allegations that he had sex with a minor, which had been investigated by the ethics committee of the US House of Representatives. \n\nBoth Republican and Democratic lawmakers had called for the report of the committee to be made public or be shared with the US Senate’s judiciary committee for confirmation hearing.\n\nGaetz, a former member of the House of Representatives from Florida, had resigned his seat just days before the ethics committee’s report was expected. \n\nThe resignation was said to be a move to prevent its release of the report under a tradition that prevents the body from investigating people who are not members of the House. However, there have been exceptions to that protocol.\n\nCNN reported that Gaetz’s withdrawal announcement came shortly after the news channel reached out to the former congressman with new allegations that he had sex with the minor not once but twice.\n\nPete Hegseth, who is Trump’s nominee for defence secretary, is also mired in controversy over news reports that he was once accused by a woman of sexually assaulting her. He has denied the allegation.",

She placed her hand atop his, adding a black heart emoji over the pic.\n\nMaloney also discreetly tagged Martin’s Instagram username in black font.\n\nThe sweet Instagram Story marked the first time Maloney, 37, has posted a photo with Martin, 41, since revealing she had a boyfriend last month. \n\nMaloney raved about how “in love” she was with “the most wonderful person” during an Oct. 16 episode of her “Disrespectfully” podcast. \n\n“He just makes me feel really special, and he’s really special, and yeah, I’m just really, really happy,” she gushed at the time.\n\nPage Six confirmed shortly after the revelation that Maloney was dating Martin. \n\nA source told us at the time that they met through mutual friends and “bonded” over their love for emo music and careers in hospitality. \n\n“Katie loves the emo music scene and has been a fan and friend of Nick’s band for some time,” the insider told us last month. “While the pair started out as friends, things took a turn this past summer in August, and their relationship developed really quickly.”\n\nMaloney’s ex-husband, Tom Schwartz, and her on-again, off-again friend Scheana Shay, also confirmed the relationship in the weeks following.\n\nShay shared on her “Scheananigans” podcast last month that she met Martin at a music festival his band was playing at and raved that “he could not have been nicer.”\n\n“He was just such a sweet guy,” Shay, 39, said. “I was glad I got to see her, meet him, see the band and overall it was a very fun weekend.”\n\nMeanwhile, Schwartz, 42, told Page Six that he had “not met [Maloney’s] new man” yet, but that he loves to “see her just thriving.” \n\n“I’m so happy for her,” he told Page Six at Lisa Vanderpump’s annual Vanderpump Dog Foundation Gala in Beverly Hills last weekend. “I mean it, I love to see her happy.”\n\nMaloney and Schwartz tied the knot in 2016 after dating for six years, but they got divorced in 2022.",

Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do!\"\n\nGaetz's withdrawal is a blow to Trump's push to install steadfast loyalists in his incoming administration and the first sign that Trump could face resistance from members of his own party to picks with eyebrow-raising backgrounds.\n\nGaetz's announcement came days after an attorney for two women said that his clients told House Ethics Committee investigators that Gaetz paid them for sex on multiple occasions beginning in 2017, when Gaetz was a Florida congressman. He resigned from the House after Trump announced he would nominate him for the Cabinet.\n\nOne of the women testified she saw Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old at a party in Florida in 2017, according to the attorney, Joel Leppard. Leppard has said that his client testified she didn't think Gaetz knew the girl was underage, stopped their relationship when he found out and did not resume it until after she turned 18. The age of consent in Florida is 18.\n\nGaetz has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and said last year that the Justice Department's investigation into sex trafficking allegations involving underage girls had ended with no federal charges against him.",

Archer has a central contract with the ECB which runs until the end of September, giving them an element of control over his workload,” the report claimed.\n\nArcher has not played Test cricket since 2021 but the England setup is confident that he will be back in action early next year. Though Rob Keys had told the Sunday Times that he has his fingers crossed over whether Archer could play Test cricket next summer, the pacer’s decision to play IPL in April-May makes it difficult for the pacer to play domestic red-ball cricket for Sussex, which could have paved way for his return to the longer former of the game.\n\nEngland Cricket Board (ECB) is in a difficult situation because if it blocks Archer’s participation in IPL 2025 as it did in the previous edition, would make him unable to be part of the mini-auction next year, as per the new rules.\n\nThe IPL has introduced new regulations for this auction cycle, stipulating that players who have previously appeared in the league but do not register for a mega-auction would be unable to register for the subsequent mini-auction. A separate regulation says that a player who is signed at an auction and then withdraws without a legitimate reason will face a two-year ban.\n\nThese new rules seem to have played a role in the 29-year-old Archer, who returned to white-ball cricket during the recent series against Pakistan, has decided to enter the auction fray.",

Kabul denies the presence of TTP terrorists on its soil. The TTP has claimed responsibility for several recent attacks inside Pakistan.\n\nLt Gen (retired) Talat Masood, an Islamabad-based security analyst, sees a combination of the Afghanistan factor, local terrorist networks and recent changes in the global security situation behind the surge in violence in Pakistan.\n\nRejecting Kabul’s denial regarding the presence and operations by TTP militants from its soil, Masood said the unprotected porous border between the two countries served as a major advantage for terrorists.\n\n“Pakistan needs to take some serious actions, including the political and economic uplift of the tribal region and Balochistan, to combat the menace of terrorism,” he added.",

        "summary": "Wrexham have enjoyed a meteoric rise under their Hollywood owners - but apparently not everyone is happy",
        "text": "Wrexham's popularity in the UK has slumped as rivals have grown jealous of their success, according to one of the club's directors.\n\nThe Red Dragons enjoyed a huge groundswell of support when they were first taken over by Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney in February 2021.\n\nThen in the National League, their fame also hit new levels around the globe following the release of the Welcome to Wrexham documentary on Disney+.\n\nDirector Shaun Harvey said this led to fans of clubs in higher divisions adopting them as their second team.\n\nHowever, with Phil Parkinson's side since earning successive promotions to League One and outspending most of their rivals in the process, the former EFL chief executive believes their approval ratings have dipped.\n\nSpeaking to US-based supporters at an event in New York this week, Harvey said: “Wrexham was the underdog in the UK when we started, but not necessarily because we were the poorest club. \n\n“We weren’t since Rob and Ryan came in, but the town of Wrexham was the underdog. \n\n“It had been downtrodden for 15 years in terms of its football and industries had left the town. It was in despair and people wanted to get out and not get in. \n\n“We got to this position where we could be everybody's favourite second team, because nobody saw Wrexham as a challenge.”\n\nHe added: “It was acceptable all of a sudden to be a Wrexham fan, as well as being a Manchester United fan, or a Liverpool fan, or any other club that you wanted to support. That positioning actually made us universally popular. \n\n“Now, how popular we are is waning in certain places in the UK. We've gone from being this plucky little underdog, to all of a sudden we're a threat, and people don't like that as much.”\n\nHarvey's comments come despite a recent YouGov survey showing that Wrexham are currently the eighth most popular club in the UK.\n\nA total of 37 per cent of people approached by the polling company said they viewed the Red Dragons in a positive light, compared to 14 per cent who disliked the team. A further 33 per cent expressed a neutral opinion.\n\nThe figures covering the third quarter of this year put them ahead of the likes of reigning Premier League champions Manchester City in the popularity stakes, as well as giants like Manchester United and Arsenal.\n\nMeanwhile, manager Phil Parkinson thinks they can still partly lay claim to underdog status as they battle big-spenders Birmingham City and former top-flight outfit Bolton Wanderers for promotion.\n\nIn an episode of the Men in Blazers podcast released yesterday, he said: “Last year and the year before, when Wrexham came to town, we were perceived as the big club. \n\n“When you go to Bolton now and places like that, that's not the case. They’re clubs who've been in the Premiership, and look at themselves as huge clubs and should be at least in the Championship. \n\n“I think we have got the underdog card a little bit and we've got to keep using that.”",

The event, on Wednesday, November 20, was held to coincide with the international Transgender Day of Remembrance, a day to remember those who have been murdered as a result of transphobia.\n\n Members of the transgender community told how their community was 'under attack' at the sombre ceremony in the city's Gay Village. Speakers at the Hurst Street vigil read out the names of more than 350 transgender and gender-diverse people who have been killed in 2024, according to a report released this week by the Trans Murder Monitoring project . \n\nA minute's silence was also held at the event as candles were lit in solidarity with those who have lost their lives, and those who continue to struggle against transphobia. The Trans Murder Monitoring project attributed the deaths this year to a 'concerted efforts of anti-gender and anti-rights movements that instrumentalise and vilify trans people to push wider anti-democratic political agenda.'\n\nREAD MORE: Teenager accused of Walsall train station murder refuses to face court\n\n Melissa Poulton, who led the Birmingham congregation, said: \"427 of our siblings have died in the last twelve months. We are being targeted, not just here but all around the world. We're here to mourn the dead and fight for the living. I’m just so grateful to have this opportunity.\" \n\nOther members of the crowd took the mic to share their experiences of transphobia. \"Remembrance is not enough, mourning is not enough,\" one speaker told the audience. \"When governments target trans people, they’re targeting humanity itself. Our shared values of equality and compassion should rule.\"\n\nTransgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR) was founded in 1999 in memory of Black transgender women Rita Hester and Chanelle Pickett, who were both murdered in Massachusetts. Marking the end of Transgender Awareness Week, TDoR memorials typically include a reading of the names of those who died from October 1 of the former year to September 30th of the current year.\n\nKim Taylor from Trans Pride Birmingham said it was important to observe Transgender Day of Remembrance in memory of those no longer with us. They said: \"[We] had a few people say a few words and were basically mentioning some of the people that have died unfortunately, whether that’s through lack of healthcare or through ending their own lives, and this is an annual thing that’s happening across the UK.\n\n\"I think especially with how the world is at the minute, it’s even more important for us to band together, whether you’re an ally, trans, in the non-binary + community; it’s important for us to all be together and show that they can’t break us, and we’ll fight for those that are struggling and honour those that have tragically passed as well.\"",

        "summary": "Case was before court as man lacks mental capacity due to alcohol-related cognitive impairments and dementia-like condition",
        "text": "The High Court has sanctioned the transfer of a 60-year-old man to a nursing home against his wishes after hearing the space will be imminently lost if the move is delayed.\n\nThe transfer orders come some five months after he became fit for discharge from an acute hospital.\n\nHis case was before the court’s “inherent jurisdiction” list on Thursday because he lacks mental capacity due to alcohol-related cognitive impairments and a dementia-like condition called Korsakoff syndrome. The court heard he needs 24-hour supervision due to his difficulties with daily living.\n\nA solicitor appointed by the court to advocate for the man’s best interests expressed concern earlier this week about constitutional issues arising from the hospital’s request for the transfer.\n\nBarrister Alan DP Brady, representing the man’s advocate, David Hickey of Curry & Hickey solicitors, said on Tuesday that it is “very clear” the man does not want to go to a nursing home. The court must be satisfied before ordering such a limitation on the man’s right to liberty, he said.\n\nMr Justice David Nolan adjourned the hospital’s application for the transfer orders until Thursday so lawyers could ascertain the ramifications of further delaying a decision in the case.\n\nOn Thursday, the judge was told that the nursing home space would be lost if it was not accepted by Friday.\n\nMr Brady said the advocate understands this places the court and the hospital in a particular position so he would neither consent nor object to the transfer orders.\n\nMr Hickey has been making enquiries about possible alternative services for the man, such as Health Service Executive (HSE) disability services, and will continue to look into this after the making of the orders, said Mr Brady.\n\nThe court heard previously that the HSE concluded the man does not meet the criteria for disability services due to having an alcohol-related brain condition.\n\nMr Brady said the HSE is treating this as an “older person” case rather than a disability case. Mr Hickey will continue to make enquiries on this but acknowledges that this is now a “more medium-term issue” than short-term one.\n\nMr Justice Nolan made the orders sought by barrister Ciara Dowd on behalf of the hospital.\n\nHe adjourned the case to February but, noting the advocate’s position, said the “door is always open in relation to this”.\n\nSign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phoneJoin The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to dateListen to our Inside Politics podcast for the best political chat and analysis",

        "text": "By THALIA BEATY and FARNOUSH AMIRI\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. House passed legislation Thursday that would give the Treasury Department unilateral authority to strip the tax-exempt status of nonprofits it claims support terrorism, alarming civil liberties groups about how a second Trump presidency could invoke it to punish political opponents.\n\nThe bill passed 219-184, with the majority of the support coming from Republicans who accused Democrats of reversing course in their support for the “common sense” proposal only after Donald Trump was elected to a second term earlier this month.\n\nSpeaking on the House floor ahead of the vote, Rep. Jason Smith, GOP chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, said his colleagues across the aisle would still be supporting the bill if Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidential United States. And we, as members of Congress, have the duty to make sure that taxpayers are not subsidizing terrorism,” the Missouri lawmaker said. “It’s very, very simple.”\n\nBut the proposal has drawn concern from a range of nonprofits who say it could be used to target organizations, including news outlets, universities, and civil society groups, that a future presidential administration disagrees with. They say it does not offer groups enough due process.\n\n“This bill is an authoritarian play by Republicans to expand the sweeping powers of the executive branch, to go after political enemies and stifle political dissent,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said on the House floor ahead of the vote.\n\nCritics also see it as redundant as it is already against U.S. law to support designated terrorist groups. The proposal, which now goes to the Democratic-controlled Senate where its fate is uncertain, would also postpone tax filing deadlines for Americans held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad.\n\nThe bill would create a new category of “terrorist supporting organizations,” according to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service of a previous version of the legislation. This category is defined as any organization the Treasury Secretary designates as having provided material support to a terrorist organization in the past three years.\n\n“We think this legislation is an overreach,” said Jenn Holcomb, vice president of government affairs at the Council on Foundations. “It would allow the Secretary of the Treasury to designate a 501c nonprofit as a terrorist organization at their discretion. And our concern is it doesn’t have enough in there to really ensure that a nonprofit understands the reasoning that a secretary designated as such.”\n\nThe bill would give a nonprofit designated as a “terror-supporting” 90 days to appeal that designation. Nonprofits like the American Civil Liberties Union have said that the bill does not require that the Secretary of Treasury disclose all the evidence that was used to make the designation.\n\nThe bill text outlines how the Treasury must send “a description of such material support or resources to the extent consistent with national security and law enforcement interests.”\n\nIf it were to become law, the bill could apply to a range of nonprofits, including membership organizations, unions and private foundations.\n\nA version of the bill was first introduced after the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the House passed a previous version of the bill in April, including with the support of some Democrats.\n\nThe bill was also brought up for a vote last week but failed to garner a two-thirds majority required under the suspension of the rules.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American representative in Congress, said Thursday before the vote it would be her third time voting against the bill.\n\n“I don’t care who the president of the United States is,” she said. “This is a dangerous and unconstitutional bill that would allow unchecked power to target nonprofit organizations as political enemies and shut them down without due process.”\n\nThalia Beaty reported from New York.",

        "text": "By THALIA BEATY and FARNOUSH AMIRI\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. House passed legislation Thursday that would give the Treasury Department unilateral authority to strip the tax-exempt status of nonprofits it claims support terrorism, alarming civil liberties groups about how a second Trump presidency could invoke it to punish political opponents.\n\nThe bill passed 219-184, with the majority of the support coming from Republicans who accused Democrats of reversing course in their support for the “common sense” proposal only after Donald Trump was elected to a second term earlier this month.\n\nSpeaking on the House floor ahead of the vote, Rep. Jason Smith, GOP chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, said his colleagues across the aisle would still be supporting the bill if Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidential United States. And we, as members of Congress, have the duty to make sure that taxpayers are not subsidizing terrorism,” the Missouri lawmaker said. “It’s very, very simple.”\n\nBut the proposal has drawn concern from a range of nonprofits who say it could be used to target organizations, including news outlets, universities, and civil society groups, that a future presidential administration disagrees with. They say it does not offer groups enough due process.\n\n“This bill is an authoritarian play by Republicans to expand the sweeping powers of the executive branch, to go after political enemies and stifle political dissent,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said on the House floor ahead of the vote.\n\nCritics also see it as redundant as it is already against U.S. law to support designated terrorist groups. The proposal, which now goes to the Democratic-controlled Senate where its fate is uncertain, would also postpone tax filing deadlines for Americans held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad.\n\nThe bill would create a new category of “terrorist supporting organizations,” according to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service of a previous version of the legislation. This category is defined as any organization the Treasury Secretary designates as having provided material support to a terrorist organization in the past three years.\n\n“We think this legislation is an overreach,” said Jenn Holcomb, vice president of government affairs at the Council on Foundations. “It would allow the Secretary of the Treasury to designate a 501c nonprofit as a terrorist organization at their discretion. And our concern is it doesn’t have enough in there to really ensure that a nonprofit understands the reasoning that a secretary designated as such.”\n\nThe bill would give a nonprofit designated as a “terror-supporting” 90 days to appeal that designation. Nonprofits like the American Civil Liberties Union have said that the bill does not require that the Secretary of Treasury disclose all the evidence that was used to make the designation.\n\nThe bill text outlines how the Treasury must send “a description of such material support or resources to the extent consistent with national security and law enforcement interests.”\n\nIf it were to become law, the bill could apply to a range of nonprofits, including membership organizations, unions and private foundations.\n\nA version of the bill was first introduced after the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the House passed a previous version of the bill in April, including with the support of some Democrats.\n\nThe bill was also brought up for a vote last week but failed to garner a two-thirds majority required under the suspension of the rules.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American representative in Congress, said Thursday before the vote it would be her third time voting against the bill.\n\n“I don’t care who the president of the United States is,” she said. “This is a dangerous and unconstitutional bill that would allow unchecked power to target nonprofit organizations as political enemies and shut them down without due process.”\n\nThalia Beaty reported from New York.",

The exact size and departments impacted were not immediately disclosed. \n\n “After a thorough review of our business, we’ve decided to reallocate resources to better support our goals and continue our focus on digital innovation while strengthening our best in class print products. We will scale back in areas that do not support our core strategy and will eliminate certain positions as we reimagine our team structures to drive long-term growth,” Debi Chirichella, president of Hearst Magazines, said in a memo to employees. \n\n “These changes will enable us to take care of our business for the long term. We’ll prioritize areas where we can deliver the highest impact and drive growth and continue to focus on producing the highest-quality storytelling, advertising solutions, and digital experiences,” the memo continued. \n\n Hearst was one of many publishers to partner with ChatGPT-owner OpenAI in recent months. In the memo, Chirichella also speaks to other new changes at Hearst Magazines. \n\n “To date, we have made significant progress toward our strategy. We’ve launched new digital advertising products, like AURA; adopted a new digital subscription management platform to help unlock growth through expanded offers, gifting and retention tools; and extended our international footprint and our Hearst Global Solutions team in London so we can be an even stronger and more strategic media partner for our clients,” Chirichella said in the memo.",

        "text": "Melbourne teenager Holly Bowles continues to fight for life after the Laos mass methanol poisoning that claimed her friend Bianca Jones.\n\nThe 19-year-olds were on a \"dream\" backpacking holiday when they consumed tainted drinks in the popular tourist destination of Vang Vieng last week.\n\nThey were transferred to hospitals in neighbouring Thailand when their conditions deteriorated.\n\nMs Jones died this week, with Thai police confirming to the ABC that she had a high concentration of methanol in her blood.\n\nMs Bowles remains on life support in a Bangkok hospital, where her parents remain by her side.\n\nThe bayside football club where the teenagers played has been rallying around their teammates.\n\nThe Beaumaris Under 18s team met at the club earlier this week to support one another.\n\nTonight's season launch has been put on hold and will instead become a chance for the the wider seniors group to gather as they grieve Ms Jones and continue to await news on Ms Bowles.\n\n\"We're offering it as an optional gathering of players just to come together and be together at this time, and just lean on each other,\" said club president Nick Heath.\n\nMr Heath said the club was gutted by the tragedy.\n\nBut he said members were pulling together to organising a fundraiser to help with the travel expenses of the Jones and Bowles families, as well as to \"bring Bianca home\" and pay for her funeral.\n\nHe said he was overwhelmed by the support shown by the local Melbourne bayside community and from across Australia.\n\n\"We know the economic circumstances in the country are very difficult for most people (but) we've had kids wanting to offer five bucks, we've had others wanting to contribute much more.\n\n\"This is something at this time of year that just resonated with everyone going off on end-of-school breaks and university breaks.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed in federal parliament yesterday when question time was paused to acknowledge the tragedy.\n\n\"Bianca's trip should have been a joyous time and a source of fond memories in years to come, memories that she should have carried with her into the long bright future that lay ahead of her,\" said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. \n\n\"It's beyond sad that this was not to be.\"\n\nThe federal member for Ms Jones and Ms Bowles's electorate, Zoe Daniel, told parliament the friends' holiday to south-east Asia was a rite of passage that many young Australians experience.\n\n\"If you were to look at their holiday photos, you would see the wonderful adventure that these best friends were having together.\n\n\"They could be any of our teenage kids.\"\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong said drink spiking and methanol poisoning was far too common in many parts of the world and implored parents and young travellers to discuss the risks.\n\n\"Please inform yourselves, please let's work together to ensure this tragedy doesn't happen again,\" she said.\n\nThe Australian Travel Industry Association's Dean Long said south-east Asia was not any more dangerous than other parts of the world, including Australia, for what he described as \"heinous\" and \"criminal\" drink spiking.\n\nBut he agreed extra precautions needed to be taken when travelling in countries where alcohol regulations were not as strict.\n\n\"If you're going to consume any food or beverage, make sure it's a closed bottle, make sure you know exactly where it's come from.\n\n\"Don't drink things just because the locals are.\n\n\"It's a higher risk environment when you go overseas.\"\n\nHe said Bali and Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Costa Rica and Turkey have had drink spiking issues over the years.\n\nBut he said it was not practical to tell young travellers not to drink alcohol at all. \n\n\"You just have to be aware and the most important thing is it's probably not the best to have open drinks.\n\n\"Make sure it's a well-recognised brand, make sure it hasn't been opened, check the safety seals.\"\n\nTwo Danish and a US tourist have also died in the Laos incident, which left up to 14 people seriously ill.",

They were apprehended during document verification.\n\nThey were trying to board a Muscat-bound flight. A verification of their travelling documents by the immigration officials revealed that the travellers’ passports had been fabricated to conceal their previous travel history.

        "text": "Far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene will lead a new congressional panel to work with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy on their plans to slash the federal budget and fire workers across the government.\n\nGreene has been tapped to chair a House subcommittee that will work in tandem with Donald Trump’s newly created Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory board that the president-elect appointed the billionaire and wealthy entrepreneur to lead.\n\nThe “Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency” is “designed to work hand in hand with President Trump, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and the entire DOGE team,” the congresswoman from Georgia said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nThe panel, first reported by Fox News Digital, will recommend firing government “bureaucrats” and will provide “transparency and truth to the American people through hearings,” according to Greene.\n\n“No topic will be off the table,” she said.\n\nThe panel will operate under the House Oversight Committee, chaired by Republican congressman James Comer of Kentucky.\n\nThe congressman told Fox News Digital that the new panel “will align with the Trump administration’s priorities to eliminate government waste, streamline the federal government’s operations and cut red tape that’s stifling jobs and increasing costs for the American people.”\n\nIn an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Musk and Ramaswamy broadly outlined their ambitions for DOGE, which expects to rely on a pair of recent Supreme Court rulings they argue give Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress unilateral authority to gut federal agencies and make drastic cuts in spending.\n\nThey want to reduce annual federal spending by at least $500 billion — specifically, by cutting $1.5 billion earmarked for “international organizations,” another $535 million to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds hundreds of locally owned public radio and television stations, and another $300 million for “progressive groups like Planned Parenthood.”\n\nMusk has said he would recommend cutting the nation’s budget by “at least $2 trillion” — or roughly one-third.\n\nThe men also argued that civil service protections won’t stop them from recommending mass firings of federal workers, and that Trump can make “large-scale firings” and move federal agencies out of Washington DC, which could result in the loss of hundreds of jobs.\n\n“A key step to driving greater efficiency in government is exposing the problem to the public — we are grateful that the House Oversight Committee has created a subcommittee to focus on this work,” a spokesperson for Ramaswamy told Fox News Digital.",

They think they’re going on vacation for five days, but in fact, we are going to see everything. I’ve planned quite a trip.’\n\nHowever, although she will be out of the country during Thanksgiving, the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia founder is planning to get right back to holiday hosting once she lands back home.\n\nAnd, she told People that it’s important to have one specific treat out for guests who come over to your home during the holiday season.\n\n‘If somebody comes over in the afternoon, you have to have homemade Christmas cookies lying around,’ Stewart said.\n\n‘You just have to, and you have to have a couple dinners for your family and friends,’ she continued.\n\nShe also admitted that there was ‘no time’ for arguments among family during this time.\n\nInstead, she likes to keep thinks ‘light-hearted.’ \n\n‘I think the holidays are sort of the time when people come to see you and exchange presents and have a little fun,’ Stewart told the outlet. \n\n‘I try to keep it very light-hearted and pleasant around the holidays. Family arguments, there’s no place for that at the holiday time.’\n\nThe businesswoman’s interview with the magazine comes just days after she made headlines for her awkward appearance on The Drew Barrymore show.\n\nStewart was a guest on the show last Tuesday, but the interview went slightly off topic when Drew, 49, bit her finger and playfully asked the mogul: ‘What makes you soft and gooey?’\n\nEventually, Stewart replied: ‘Soft and gooey treatment.’\n\n‘Soft and gooey treatment?’ mom-of-two Drew repeated, as she proceeded to start caressing her guest’s arm. ‘When you’re treated like a lady?’\n\n‘It’s nice,’ Stewart confirmed.\n\n‘When someone comes in…’ Drew continued, but before she could complete her sentence Stewart batted her away while declaring ‘you’re the wrong gender!’\n\n‘I know, I know,’ the E.T. actress relented as she dramatically fell back on the sofa.\n\n‘Although, the way it’s going with men though, Martha, I’m not so sure anymore.’",

        "text": "EastEnders icon Lacey Turner has revealed she's looking forward to the \"next chapter\" in her life.\n\n The star who is best known for playing loveable Stacey Slater on the BBC One soap occasionally shares an insight into her personal life with fans on social media. In September this year, the star, 36, announced that she and her husband Matt Kay were expecting their third child together. \n\n Taking to Instagram, Lacey shared a snap of herself, Matt and their two children posing on a beach as she beamed while showing off her ultrasound scan showing off her unborn little one. \"Aren't we lucky….. @thekayoskids,\" she captioned her stunning upload. Now, in a rare interview, Lacey has opened up about preparing for the arrival of her little one.\n\n\"I'm excited for all of us really,\" she gushed as she spoke to the Mirror. She went on to add: \"It's like another chapter in our little story, yeah I am excited. There's nothing better than a newborn and a newborn cuddle, so that would be lovely. Yeah, we're really excited and we're looking forward to it.\" But this means that Lacey is set to take a break from her EastEnders role – although no details about Stacey's exit have been confirmed.\n\nBut Lacey is already preparing a very sweet gift for her baby – a photo book filled with precious family memories. \"You take lots of photos of them, 1000s of photos,\" she said. Lacey continued: \"I make one for my kids every year, I make thema photo book of their year, I just feel like when they're older, what if they want to look at the photos of themselves and they don't know how to get them off the stick, or don't know where they're going to be in a cloud or in a computer or something.\n\n\"I love sitting looking through photos, it's nice that I do it fo them, so I should be making three.\" But one thing Lacey isn't worried about, however, is the sleepless nights that comes with having a newborn. \"Oh that's ok,\" she chuckled over Zoom. This year, Lacey has teamed up with CEWE as she explored the dos and don'ts in the run up to Christmas.\n\nShe continued to open up about the next few months as she and her family gear up for her new arrival, saying: \"I love this time of year and obviously we, you know, we've got a lot going on in our house but it's going to be lovely. As the children grow older, it's lovely. They change so much ad this age and it's lovely to see they're going through their little milestones and it's great. \n\n\"I love being cold, cozy cardigans and fires, I don't know – I just love everything about this time of year!\" Lacey highlighted that 73 per cent of Brits admit to being disappointed by gifts they receive each Christmas. Elsewhere, it was revealed that novelty gifts, household mops and socks are rated as some of the worst presents to buy for loved ones.\n\nMeanwhile, a whopping 75 per cent of Brits believe that the price tag never matters, it's the thoughts and sentiments behind the presents that are the real value.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs onTikTok,Snapchat,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,YouTubeandThreads.",

        "text": "Piers Morgan has expressed his delight at Roy Keane after his rude joke about Jill Scott went viral on social media. \n\n The ex-Manchester United captain was renowned for his fierce competitiveness during his playing days, but has shown a softer side since becoming a regular presence on our screens. His work as a pundit for ITV and on The Overlap have revealed a sharp wit which he isn’t afraid to use at the expense of others. \n\n While filming the latest episode of the Stick to Football podcast with Scott, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and Ian Wright, Keane dropped a risque gag which had the room in stitches. And, thankfully for Keane, former England midfielder Scott took it in the lighthearted manner that it was intended. \n\n \"I was playing a charity game at the weekend and Marlon Harewood absolutely smashed us, he's a big guy,\" Scott told the room. Scholes said \"he's a big guy\" and Neville added \"he was a big old thing, old Marlon,\" before Keane stopped the conversation dead with a one-liner: \"And what was the game like?\" \n\nKeane played dumb, pretending he hadn’t meant his comment in the way everyone had taken it while bursting into laughter. Stifling laughter, Wright said: \"Roy, you can't say that! That's got to go!\" But Scott pleaded with the producers: \"Please keep that in...\"\n\n The clip of the gag has gone down a storm on social media, racking up 2.7million views on Twitter, where Morgan gave his take on the situation. \n\nHe tweeted: “This is very ‘inappropriate’, and will deeply offend every member of the joyless over-sensitive snowflake woke brigade, who will all now demand Roy Keane be cancelled (good luck with that… ) - and I laughed my head off.”\n\nIt doesn’t seem likely that Keane is going to get ‘cancelled’ as Morgan suggests. But his joke certainly derailed the conversation, with Wright stating: \"It's such a powerful image! I can't unsee it!\"\n\nIf he did actually mean it, Keane did eventually get the answer to his question, with Scott saying the match ended 7-6. He picked up plenty of comments below the line, too, with viewers hailing his sense of humour.\n\n“Roy Keane has to be hands down the most unintentionally funny pundit on the planet,” one person wrote. A second added: “Keane needs his own show. Comedy gold.” Another person felt the joke was genuinely intended, writing: “Keane is so deadpan matter of fact, I think he genuinely was interested in the actual football score”.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

        "summary": "China warned the U.S. against actions that could escalate the Ukraine conflict following Biden's authorizing Ukraine's use of ATACMS missiles.",
        "text": "China issued a warning to the United States after President Joe Biden authorized long-range targeting inside Russia with ATACMS rockets capable of hitting positions up to 190 miles away.Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the U.S., told Newsweek: \"Realizing an early ceasefire and striving for political settlement serves the interests of all sides.\"It is important not to fuel the tension. China always encourages and supports all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis and stands ready to continue to play a constructive role in its own way for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.\"Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment.Ukraine fired long-range ATACMS missiles against a target inside Russia for the first time on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian news agency RBC-Ukraine, citing a source inside the country's defense forces.China presents itself as a neutral party, emphasizing respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations, including Ukraine. It has called for dialogue and peaceful resolution rather than military action.Although China has previously attempted to mediate a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, it has faced accusations of supplying weapons to Putin for use in the conflict.Despite its apparent neutral stance, China has refrained from condemning Russia's actions or labeling them as an invasion. Its diplomatic rhetoric often aligns with Russian narratives, criticizing NATO's expansion and Western sanctions.Beijing is a major purchaser of Russian energy and goods. The war has deepened this economic relationship, especially as Western sanctions have isolated Russia.China has positioned itself as a potential mediator in the conflict. In early 2023, it released a 12-point peace plan advocating for a ceasefire.China faces accusations of indirectly supporting Russia through increased trade and allegedly providing dual-use technologies that might bolster Russia's war effort.Its refusal to explicitly denounce Russia's invasion has drawn criticism from Western nations, highlighting a perceived alignment with Moscow.Meanwhile, China denies reports it has been supplying Russia with attack drones as European Union foreign ministers met Monday to discuss the alleged evidence.In September, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's adviser said over half of the foreign-made parts in Russian weapons found in Ukraine come from and via China.In response, a Chinese embassy official suggested to Newsweek that most foreign-made weapon components used by Russia originate in the U.S. or from its Western allies.",

        "summary": "These are all the new payment rates for disability benefits and Carer's Allowance from next April",
        "text": "The Department for Work and Pensions has issued the new payment rates for disability and carer benefits starting in April 2025, including Personal Independence Payment (PIP). Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced benefit increases of 1.7 per cent in the October Budget, and the exact amounts for the 2025/2026 financial year have today been detailed.\n\nThere are now 3.6 million people claiming PIP including thousands in Scotland who will eventually be moved to the new Adult Disability Payment introduced to replace PIP for everyone north of the border.\n\nMore than 1.3 million people of all ages receive Disability Living Allowance, which is now only available to be claimed for children under 16, while another 1.6 million people get Attendance Allowance, a disability payment for those over State Pension age. DLA payments for children are being replaced by the new Child Disability Payment in Scotland.\n\n DWP confirms new study of PIP claimants' spending ahead of fundamental reforms DWP benefit change update for everyone on PIP, DLA and Carer's Allowance \n\nJust over a million people get Carer's Allowance for looking after someone who is on disability benefits. If you claim Universal Credit as well, the full monthly equivalent of your Carer's Allowance is deducted from your payment but Universal Credit offers its own similar support in the form of a top-up called Carer Element.\n\nCarer's Allowance can only be claimed by those who spend at least 35 hours looking after someone and earn less than £151 from a paid job they fit in on top of that. However, overpayments accumulated by people who continue to receive the benefit after inadvertently going above the wage limits, even by the slightest amount, have become an issue in recent years.\n\nIn a move that could help ease these issues, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in the October Budget that the earnings threshold for Carer's Allowance is to increase from £151 per week to £196 per week starting in April 2025. This is equivalent to working 16 hours at the National Living Wage. In Scotland, Carer's Allowance is being replaced by the new Carer Support Payment with all claimants to be moved across by spring 2025.\n\nHere are the new weekly rates for disability and carer benefits in England and Wales. They will come into effect from April 7, 2025, the first full week of the new financial year.\n\nAttendance Allowance\n\nHigher weekly rate: increasing from £108.55 to £110.40\n\nLower weekly rate: increasing from £72.65 to £73.90\n\nCarer's Allowance\n\nCarer's Allowance weekly rate: increasing from £81.90 to £83.30\n\nUniversal Credit Carer Element: increasing from £198.31 a month to £201.68 a month\n\nDisability Living Allowance\n\nCare component\n\nHighest weekly rate: increasing from £108.55 to £110.40\n\nMiddle weekly rate: increasing from £72.65 to £73.90\n\nLowest weekly rate: increasing from £28.70 to £29.20\n\nMobility component\n\nHigher weekly rate: increasing from £75.75 to £77.05\n\nLower weekly rate: increasing from £28.70 to £29.20\n\nPersonal Independence Payment (PIP)\n\nDaily living component\n\nEnhanced weekly rate: increasing from £108.55 to £110.40\n\nStandard weekly rate: increasing from £72.65 to £73.90\n\nMobility component\n\nEnhanced weekly rate: increasing from £75.75 to £77.05\n\nStandard weekly rate: increasing from £28.70 to £29.20\n\nSevere Disablement Allowance\n\nBasic rate: increasing from £98.40 to £100.05\n\nAge-related addition (from Dec 90)\n\nHigher weekly rate: increasing from £14.70 to £14.95\n\nMiddle weekly rate: increasing from £8.15 to £8.30\n\nLower weekly rate: increasing from £8.15 to £8.30\n\n Get breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp. Join our dedicated community for the latest updates.

U.S. prosecutors and regulators said the secret bribery scheme defrauded U.S. investors in Adani's companies.\n\nWho said what\nAdani and his codefendants \"orchestrated an elaborate scheme to bribe Indian government officials to secure contracts worth billions of dollars\" for Adani Green Energy, then \"lied about the bribery scheme\" to \"enrich themselves at the expense of the integrity of our financial markets,\" Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. Adani and his associates allegedly kept meticulous records of \"their bribes and offers to Indian officials using messaging apps, phones and PowerPoint presentations,\" The New York Times said. Prosecutors said Adani also met with government officials to personally advance the bribery scheme.\n\nAdani, 62, was \"once Asia's richest man — and briefly the world's second-richest person\" — until 2023 fraud allegations by a Wall Street investigative firm \"tarnished his net worth\" and reputation, The Washington Post said.

        "summary": "Ellen DeGeneres and her wife Portia de Rossi are reportedly moving to the United Kingdom following President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s victory in November.",
        "text": "Ellen DeGeneres and wife Portia de Rossi are reportedly saying cheerio to the United States following President-elect Donald Trump's victory earlier this month. The embattled comedian, known for her robust real estate portfolio, has allegedly settled in the Cotswolds in England, a person close to the TV personality told The Wrap. She and de Rossi previously listed their multi-million dollar home in Montecito, California, with Riskin Partners. Fox News Digital confirmed that their home was sold in August. HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS DESPONDENT OVER TRUMP VICTORY FEELS 'ANXIETY' FOR PEOPLE STUCK IN AMERICA The DeGeneres source told the outlet that Trump's re-election had inspired the couple's decision to jump ship. DeGeneres announced her support for Vice President Kamala Harris in September by reposting Taylor Swift's Instagram endorsement. She simply added, \"This childless cat lady couldn’t agree more,\" a direct dig at Vice President-elect JD Vance. DeGeneres had previously declared that she had been \"kicked out of show business\" in her Netflix standup special, \"For Your Approval,\" released on September 24. Reports of a toxic workplace environment on her talk show in 2020 drove Warner Bros. to do an internal investigation. DeGeneres ultimately apologized, but the damage was done. Representatives for DeGeneres and Rossi did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. DeGeneres' reported move follows empty threats from other A-listers, including Cher, Sharon Stone and Barbra Streisand, who had threatened to leave the United States if Trump were victorious once again. Speaking with The Guardian in 2023, Cher said she \"almost got an ulcer the last time\" Trump nearly regained power. \"If he gets in, who knows? This time I will leave [the country].\" TRUMP'S VICTORY: HOLLYWOOD ELITE WHO VOWED TO LEAVE US IF HE WON ARE 'ALL TALK, NO WALK,' EXPERT SAYS Earlier this summer, Stone told the Daily Mail that she was toying with the idea of moving to Europe. \"I am certainly considering a house in Italy,\" she said in July. \"I think that’s an intelligent construct at this time. This is one of the first times in my life that I’ve actually seen anyone running for office on a platform of hate and oppression.\" LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

I can't live in this country if he became president,\" she announced on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, noting that England might be the place she lands. Weeks ago, actress Eva Longoria made waves by sharing her \"anxiety\" for Americans who would have to stay in the country under a Trump regime. \"I would like to think our fight continues,\" she told Marie Claire in an interview days after the election was called. She noted that she thinks the country is \"a scary place,\" adding, \"If he keeps his promises, it’s going to be a scary place.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

        "text": "Former Deputy National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Bode George, has urged former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to jettison his presidential ambition ahead of the 2027 presidential election, just as tasked the party leadership to save the main opposition platform from collapsing.\n\nChief George gave this counsel on Thursday at a press briefing held in his Ikoyi, Lagos office to mark his 79th birthday, saying that the political ambition of Atiku may destroy the party if not put in check, but quickly vowed that some members, including himself would not allow his “desperation to destroy this party.” \n\nGeorge, who is also the Atona Oodua of Yoruba land, said there was the need to reposition the party before the 2027 general elections, calling on the Chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT) of PDP, Senator Adolphis Wabara, to invite all national elders of the party for a meeting on the way forward for it before the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the party slated for 28th November, 2024.\n\nHe said that this became imperative because some members, were allegedly working for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the build-up to the 2027 elections, saying that the affected members “have one leg in PDP and another leg in APC.”\n\nAccording to him, such people, who he described as chameleonic characters are the ones trying to dictate the direction of this party, saying that their outburst was always marked by unwarranted claims to political and social standing in the country.\n\n“I am raising the alarm today that our party is at the precipice of a dangerous looming crisis, if pending critical party issues are not urgently addressed.\n\nALSO READ: I won’t stop calling out Abiodun’s govt — PDP’s Adebutu\n\n“In fact, our party is derailing. And this is unfortunate because the crisis in our party has further complicated the present tragedy in the socio-economic indices of our dear nation.\n\n“It is a pity that some members, who are pretentious, are already working for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the build-up to the 2027 elections. They have one leg in PDP and another leg in APC. Such chameleonic characters are the ones trying to dictate the direction of this party. Their rhetoric is always marked by unwarranted claims to political and social standing, power and dominance, using meaningless language with an exaggerated style and importance to impress Nigerians and APC,” the PDP chieftain said.\n\nChief George, however, advised those who were thinking of bringing the party down because they did not have their way to learn from the late Chief Alex Ekwueme, who he said was one of the founding fathers of PDP, contested the the presidential ticket with the former President Olusegun Obasanjo and lost, but did not work for the opposition as he “ensured that this party remained strong till he died.”\n\n“Pa Ekwueme and others started this party with G14 and G34. They laid a solid foundation for PDP.\n\n“He contested and lost against former President Olusegun Obasanjo. Despite that, he did not threaten anybody. He did not work for the opposition. Instead, he ensured that this party remained strong till he died,” George said.\n\nREAD MORE FROM: NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\n\n\r\n\r\nGet real-time news updates from Tribune Online!
